This means farmers should plan carefully according to the locations of their tree plantations. Firebreaks can be made either manually (clearing vegetation through digging and slashing to ground level) or through controlled burning. Manual clearing is expensive and is not recommended on steep slopes as it will lead to erosion. Controlled burning is usually the best method of preparing firebreaks and it should be carried out when the sorrounding vegetation is still green. When carrying out controlled burning, a useful technique is to spray a line of Glyphosate which is 1 metre wide on either side of the firebreak to be made (this spraying should be done when the firebreak and sorrounding vegetation is still green). As soon as the sprayed lines have dried, vegetation in the sprayed lines can be burnt off safely. Once the vegetation found in between the sprayed lines has dried off naturally it can also be burnt off since the cleared lines on either side prevent the fire from spreading to other places. Whenever controlled burning is being done people should be ready with fire fighting equipment in case conditions change or the fire jumps to another area. Farmers should also never carry out any burning when conditions are dangerous (when it is too hot or vegetation around is too dry). In areas where vegetation does not dry off naturally, firebreaks can be made by slashing vegetation but the slashing should be done as close to the ground as possible.The slashed vegetation should be left to dry and then it should be collected in the middle of the firebreak and it should be burnt when it is safe to burn and before the fire season starts.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:32\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sts9AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"filling","id":"a0r70000000StsMAAS","content":"Cotton will germinate in 7 to 10 days.

All vaccination should be done withthe help of a veterinary doctor or a trained person and only healthy animals (free from signs of worm infestation) should be vaccinated. Cows in late pregnancy or that have just given birth should not be vaccinated. If different vaccines for different diseases are to be given to the same animal then an interval of atleast 1 month should be left between each vaccine given.ï¿½\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to stop calves from taking milk","id":"a0r70000000StPQAA0","content":"Weaning (stopping calves from feeding on milk) should be done when they are 3 months old (at this age they should  weigh between 60 to 80 kg).

Diseased plants may manage to produce storage roots, but these usually have some discoloured, infected vascular tissues. Rot may follow in storage or the disease may be transmitted to the next crop by infected cuttings. Dying vines often have pinkish fungal growth.  Control: Use resistant varieties,  Use disease-free planting stocks, Avoid fields with a history of wilt. To reduce infection near planting time is to hold plants for 24 hours at 29ï¿½C to promote suberisation of the injured surface; also yield loss can be reduced by planting more than one transplant per hill. Even though the percent of plants affected is not reduced, yield per unit land is maintained because there is less chance that all plants in a hill will be killed and also because productivity is similar for single-plant and multiple-plant hill.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NRI, CIP, NARO, FAO, CPP, DFID\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StU5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Inner edible part of the roots black and brittle","id":"a0r70000000StanAAC","content":"These are symptoms of Diplodia black storage rot.

A cow that has given birth should be monitored to confirm if the placenta remains inside.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Lung worms Cows coughing alot especially after running difficulty in breathing and breathing too quickly cows starting to look unhealthy","id":"a0r70000000StPYAA0","content":"This is caused by lung worms which attack the inner parts of livestock where air passes before it enters the lungs. Cattle infected with lung worms may get a disease called parasitic bronchitis; calves are more likely to get affected by this disease.

SYMPTOMS include cattle coughing alot especially when they are chased  breathing too quickly  difficulty in breathing  cattle quickly losing their condition (they start looking unhealthy) and in serious cases cattle affected by lung worms can die. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Lung worms can be prevented if farmers regularly deworm their cattle; adult cattle should be dewormed atleast 1 time in every 6 months while calves should be dewormed 1 time in every 3 months (WARNING: Regular use of the same type of drug when deworming may result in parasites becoming resistant to that drug which makes it no longer effective. Selecting drugs to use when deworming should be done with the help of veterinary doctors in your area). Farmers should also make sure that the pasture and water given to animals is clean and not contaminated with dung or any other thing.Treatment: When symptoms are seen farmers should consult veterinary doctors and also tell them when the affected cattle were last dewormed and which drug was used when deworming.

There are cases where the hind feet show first when a calf is being born (this will be seen if the feet appear upside down as they come out); and when this happens the farmer will need to give help to the cow as it gives birth. When the hind legs show first, the farmer should wait until the feet have come out from the cow?s vulva and then they should start pulling the legs gently at the same time as the cow pushes (the person pulling should first wait and feel the cow pushing then they should gently pull the calf out; they should stop pulling when the cow stops pushing and carry on pulling when it starts pushing again). Once the hind quarter of the calf is out (and only the upper part is left inside the cow) farmers should make sure that the calf gets out quickly. Other abnormal ways in which a calf being born may come out of the cow include the tail showing first, twisted neck, one leg showing first and the farmer should quickly get help from a veterinarydoctor in such any of these cases occur.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of a cow about to give birth","id":"a0r70000000StQ1AAK","content":"Between 1 and 2 weeks before giving birth, the cow's vulva swells, the udder becomes large, firm, full and may start producing a thick milky substance. On the day of giving birth, the cow separates itself from the rest of the herd, holds its tail high and off the vulva opening, becomes restless and a clear mucus substance may begin to flow from the vulva. At the actual time of giving birth, the water sac which contains the unborn calf appears and the front feet of the calf appear after the water sac breaks.  During the process of giving birth the cow should be left to produce the calf on its own for atleast 12 hours before farmers come in to try and offer any help.  When the calf is born farmers should remove the mucus from the mouth and nostrils of the calf and let the mother of the calf lick the mucus from the rest of the calf's body. The calf's umbilical chord should be cut with a sharp, clean (preferably new) blade and then it should be dipped in iodine solution (this can be got from an animal clinic). If the newborn calf is having difficulty in breathing then the farmer should scratch its nose using a dry piece of grass, hold its hind legs and swing it gently forward and backward orpour cold water on its nose to make it sneeze.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparing for birth of calves","id":"a0r70000000StQ2AAK","content":"The gestation period of a cow will last between 274 and 291 days (9 months).

At the entrance of the dip tank a foot bath helps to remove soil from the feet of the animals so that it does not contaminate the chemical in the dip tank. Foot baths are also put at the gate of the farm for visitors entering the farm to disinfect their feet before entering the farm; foot baths help to kill parasites and disease causing organisms that the animals or visitors may be caring on their feet. Use of foot baths also helps to control foot rot by killing the bacteria that cattle may have on their feet. Foot baths should be at least 2 metres in length and 0.15 metres deep.  The width  of the foot path should be the same as that of the passage where they are placed to prevent cows from bypassing the bath without using it.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNSAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Calving area","id":"a0r70000000StQ4AAK","content":"Housing structures built for cattle should also have an area where pregnant cows can calve (give birth) from; this is called a calving stall and  it makes it possible for farmers to provide special attention to cows at the important time of giving birth.  With loose housing, cows may need to be tied up in stalls and should give birth far away from the milking area and close to the area where calves are kept. The area in which cows give birth shouldbe easy to clean and disinfect thoroughly. There should be one calving stall for every 30 stalls with a minimum of 2;\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

Coccidiosis can kill a large number of chicken before it is identified (this means the disease can attack and kill birds before showing any major signs). Coccidiosis is common in chicken that are being kept under a deep litter system and when the disease breaks out it usually spreads quickly (because birds are always in contact with litter which may have droppings that have the disease) so farmers must do all they can to preventthe disease from breaking out. SIGNS: Affected chicken lose appetite and look dull and weak; sometimes the chicken may also pass out blood stained droppings. The disease also causes a high number of deaths in young chicken and when dead birds are cut open their intestines will be swollen. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure chicks, feed and water are kept away from chicken droppings; chicken should not be overcrowded in the house in which they are being kept. Litter used in the chicken house should be kept dry, turned regularly and any wet areas in it should be removed and replaced with dry litter. If coccidiosis breaks out farmers must immediately remove birds that show signs of the disease and should start treating them immediately. There are drugs (called anticoccidials or coccidiostats) that farmers can mix in chicken feeds to help reduce levels of infection when coccidiocis breaks out (chicken that are to be slaughtered should not be given these drugs atleast 4 days before they are killed to  avoid drugs staying inside the carcass). Chicken with coccidiocis can also be treated by giving them drinking water in which Amprollium has been mixed (farmers MUST always seek advice from veterinary personnel on which drugs to use, amounts to use and how to mix the drugs).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StP1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Vaccination","id":"a0r70000000StP2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Keeping records of chicken","id":"a0r70000000StP3AAK","content":"It is very important for farmers to keep information on the broiler chicken they are keeping; this is called record keeping.

Farmers should turn the litter regularly (using a hoe, shovel or garden rake) so that it remains dry and does not become hard (it should be easy to break up into small bits when it is held in the hands). If litter in a chicken house is not looked after well it will develop a hard surface layer which can give broilers problems like breast blisters (when the birds rest down on hard litter the area around their breasts is bruised and develops wounds which later become hard; this lowers the quality of meat got from the broilers.

Remove weeds early ( before changing plants from the nursery to the field), dig and break up or turn over the soil to expose cutworms to natural enemies and for them to dry out,dig near damaged young plants and destroy cutworms.Chemicals like Dursban 4EC can be applied in the soil to control Cut worms. Please follow the manufacturers advice when using these chemicals\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Spots on leaves are brown and circular with grey centers anddark brown margins","id":"a0r70000000StmVAAS","content":"This is Gray leaf spot. Appears as circular spots/dots on leaves. The spots/dots are at first brown, later turning white with sunken centres and reddish margins. The symptoms can appear on stems but have not been seen on fruit. Spots on leaves are brown and circular with small to large grey centres and dark brown margins.  Wounds may be many causing leaves to turn yellow, then brown and drop.Infected leaves are dropped off the plant. General loss of leaves occurs under severe disease pressure. Fruits are not attacked. The fungus survives on seeds and in crop wastes. The disease is favoured by long periods of rain. Control is by Planting resistant cultivars if available,use of certified disease-free seeds and practicing good field sanitation. Avoid watering the plants.Water only around the roots. Avoid establishing seedbeds near tomato or pepper fields.It can be easily controlled by fungicides applied on leaves like Indofil M-45.\nPlease follow the manufacturers advice when using these

can also be fed using using buckets; bucket feeding helps farmers to control the amount of milk calves are taking each day (which prevents diseases like scours) and is also helpful when a cow dies and leaves calves behind.  It may not be easy to train calves how to drink from a bucket so it is important to start early. The first few days of bucket feeding are the most important so farmers should make sure that the calf gets enough milk at this time. Bucket feeding should be started when calves are between 2 to 3 days old. Farmers should keep weighing calves because this helps them know how much milk to give the calves at different stages. In the first 2 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/10 of their body weight and feeding should be done 3 times a day. In the next 3 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/5 of their body weight and feeding should be done 2 times a day. After 5 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/20 of their body weight until they are weaned and feeding should be done 2 times aday. Calves should be fed at the same time each day and milk should be given to calves immediately after it has been milked.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:15:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su9lAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Animal advice","id":"a0r70000000Su0SAAS","content":"Moses Tella Chemusto 0779465546.

Maize smut disease is common in dry, hot maize growing areas as well as mid hill areas with weather that is neither too hot or too cold. Signs of maize smut include maize cobs becoming swollen and with an abnormal shape, male flowers growing too big and abnormal in shape, black masses of powdery things developing inside male flowers and in the place of normal maize cobs. Maize cobs affected by maize smut disease may not develop any maize grains on the cob. Prevention and control: The best, easiest and cheapest way a farmer can fight maize smut disease is planting seed types which resist maize smut. Farmers should also remove the abnormal swellings from diseased maize plants as soon as they are seen but it may be best to completely remove the whole maize plant which is affected. When digging farmers should be careful not to make any cuts on maize plants and they shouldfight any pests since smut enters through cuts on the maize plant or holes left by pests. Other ways to control smut include crop rotation, keeping maize fields clean, removing and destroying smut swellings on maize plants immediately they are seen (this helps to reduce presence of the disease in the next season).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves having grey greenish long spots that look like cigarettes","id":"a0r70000000StZZAA0","content":"This disease is called turcicum leaf blight and it often occurs in areas which usually have heavy, frequent rain, high humidity and low temperature during maize growing seasons. Damage to maize may be serious if the disease occurs before or at flowering stage, before or at silking stage or if conditions that favor the disease are present. Signs of turcicumleaf blight include slightly oval water-soaked small spots produced on leaves. The spots are dark and greyish-green in colour and as time goes on they become bigger and long shaped like cigarettes. They may appear first on lower leaves and increase in number as maize plants develop and the spots may join and form large areas which can kill maize leaves. Heavily infected leaves appear dry as if affected by drought. Prevention and control: To control the disease, farmers should plant resistant maize types, and fields which have been affected by the disease should be rotated with non cereal crops like sunflower, soybean for atleast 1 year. When carrying out crop rotation farmers must rotate maize with crops which cannot be affected by turcicum leaf blight disease. Farmers should not plant maize if maize which was in the garden during the previous season was attacked by turcicum leaf blight. Leftover parts of plants which were attacked by turcicum leaf blight should be buried soon after harvest so that they can rot quickly and prevent the disease from occuring again. Farmers can also get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which fungicides to use and when to spray maize (it is usually best to spray when spots first become visible on the lower leaves) in order to effectively control turcicum leaf blight.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves having rectangular elongated brownish gray dead spots running parallel to leaf veins","id":"a0r70000000StZaAAK","content":"This disease is called gray leaf spot and is caused by some types of fungi. The disease may increase in maize if a farmer does little ploughing or digging in a maize garden. Gray leaf spot develops quickly if maize is in conditions of high humidity and when its leaves stay wet for long. Maize which has gray leaf spot may have its leaves start to look like they are very old immediately after flowering and grains found on the maize cobs will be of poor quality. Signs of the disease include leaves having small scratches or dead areas surrounded by yellow which are visible when the leaf is held up against the sun and within about 2 weeks these spots become rectangular elongated brown gray dead spots growing parallel to the leaf veins. These gray dead spots may join and make the whole affected leaf dry upand die. Prevention and control: Farmers should plant maize seeds which are resistant to diseases, avoid moisture or wetness getting onto the leaf surfaces (for example irrigation should be done late in the afternoon or early evening especially after it is seen that gray leaf spot disease has attacked the maize garden). The disease can be controlled by planting maize seeds which are resistant to the disease and keeping the maize garden clean. Farmers can also use some chemicals (fungicides) tocontrol gray leaf spot but they MUST always get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which chemical to use when fighting gray leaf spot disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Very small scattered spots on youngest leaves white to yellowish narrow broken lines running parrallel along leaves","id":"a0r70000000StZbAAK","content":"This disease is called maize streak and it is caused by a virus which is spread by leafhoppers after they have fed on maize plants which have the disease. Leafhoppers that have fed on infected plants can carry and spread the maize streak virus for a long time. Maize streak can also be found in wild grasses and many cereal crops. Signs of maize streak disease include very small round scattered spots in the youngest leaves of maize plants which start appearing on the youngest leaves within a week after maize has been infected with the virus. The number of spots increases as the plant grows and they enlarge into narrow broken lines running parallel to the leaf veins.With time the spots become very many at leaf bases and fully grown leaves lose their green colour developing broken yellow lines along the leaf veins. Infected maize may grow slowly and if it is affected early it will not develop cobs or will die while it is still very young. Prevention andcontrol: Farmers should plant maize seeds which are resistant to diseases (disease resistant maize seeds can be got from most farm input supplier shops). Other ways to control maize streak disease include planting maize early in the season, removing all grass weeds in or around the maize garden and controlling leafhoppers.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"What to do before harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StZcAAK","content":"To ensure a good standard of quality of maize to be harvested farmers should make sure the drying place/equipment is clean and disinfected, remove old grain and dirt from things like harvesting tools, carts, bags or baskets that will come into contact with harvested grain (if possible fumigate or treat them with boiling water to kill insects and their eggs to avoid infection of new grain).

NOTE that pineapples are low in sugar content and unripe pineapples do notripen after harvest. Generally the fruits are mature and ready for harvest when they snap off at the bending of the fruit and these can be stored/ transported to distant markets. Fresh fruits destined for the local market are plucked when almost ripe while those destined for export are harvested when beginning to turn yellow-green at the fruit base. They are cut off with a sharp knife, leaving a stem which is later trimmed to 3.4cm. Some times ripeness and quality can be judged by snapping a finger against the side of the fruit. A good, ripe fruit gives a dull, solid sound while immaturity and poor quality fruits give a hollow knock. Harvested fruits can be stored up to 4-6 weeks at 7ï¿½C. NEVER bruise fruits as this will cause rotting and lower quality.

The rate at which passion fruits grow and the amount of yield harvested depend on how fertile the soil is. Farmers can improve soil fertility by adding fertilisers and the best fertilisers to add is organic manure (like cow dung  compost  chicken liter). Farmers can repeatedly add fertiliser to soil after harvesting to help restore nutrients that have been lost from the soil  nutrients that have been used up by the passion fruit trees and to increase the speed at which young branches grow since these young branches later onproduce fruit. Adding manure to soil in passion fruit gardens also helps to control the effect of viruses on the growth of passion fruits (Since plants have a high level of nutrition they wont be strongly affected by virus attacks). Passion fruit flowers may die if the soil does not have enough potassium and farmers can avoid this by adding manure to the soil. Adding manure to soil also increases soil's ability to hold moisture and promotes continuous growth in plants. Inorganic fertilizers suchas NPK (17:17:17)  NPK (10:5:20  at 1.36 kg per plant 4 times a year) and Murate can also be used (get instructions from stockists on how to use these fertilisers).

Pruning also helps to expose pests to their enemies like predators  and to unfavorable conditions like strong sunshine  rain and wind  it helps to disentangle the holdings of the tendrils so that each of the branches hangs on its own for ease of management and pruning  helps to ensure that important parts of the plant get enough nutrients which helps these parts to produce big high quality marketable fruits. Ensure that only one shoot is led to the support wire. When pruning  allow the terminal shoot to grow above the support wire by about 10 cm  and then cut off the bud. This will stimulate production of lateral branches and the farmer should select only two of them and try making each one to grow towards the pole. As they grow along the wire attached to the support poles  they will also produce other branches. These branches should be helped to hang by disentangling the holdings of the tendrils. If this is not done  the branches will tie up resulting in poor exposure of leaves to sunshine  poor exposure of flowers to pollinators  raising temperatures of the plant that may start the out break of brown spot disease and makes pruning difficult. ALWAYS disinfect tools every after pruning a plant to prevent disease spread from one plant to another. Dip tools in JIK after working on each plant  heat tools in flame or use alcohol methanol to clean them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed control","id":"a0r70000000StgWAAS","content":"Weeds are dangerous to passion fruits since they harbor pests and diseases  compete with plants for nutrients leading to low yields. Removing weeds from passion fruits helps eliminate hosts of mites and other passion fruit pests (like mites  aphids  white flies and thrips)  lowers competition for nutrients and water  eliminates risk of diverting away beneficial insects (like bees which help pollinate passion fruits). Removing weeds also eases general crop management  eliminates risk of fire in dry weeds  lowers risk of rats and rodent attacks. Farmers can control weeds in passion fruits by ring hoeing around the passion fruit plants (the circle dug around the passion fruit plant should be 1.5 m in diameter) and slashing the rest of the area or by spraying herbicides (herbicides should be sprayed away from passion fruit plants and they should be applied in a manner that wind does not blow herbicide to the passion fruits). Farmers should only apply herbicides like Propanil that will only kill weed parts in contact or Butachlor and 2 4-D that will kill whole weed plants after single point contact. Farmers should be careful when removing weeds from passion fruit gardens since injuries to the base of the vines may allow entrance of disease causing organisms. Damaging passion fruit vines during weeding can be avoided by hand weeding or the application of herbicides around the main passion fruit stems (these practices will also protect passion fruit roots which are shallow and can easily be damaged).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

Most pig farmers in Uganda do not carry weaning early because it requires an expensive diet for the piglets and needs farmers to provide alot of care. The best way to do this may be by removing the mother from the pig house and leaving piglets in an area they are used to for some time. Weaning should be done slowly over a 4 day period by reducing food given to the female pig each day to just 3 kg since this will help to make it stop producing milk for the piglets. Farmers can also practice split weaning and this is done by removing all piglets that are above average size from the litter at the end of the 5th week and allowing small piglets to suckle for an extra 4 to 5 days. This gives small piglets a chance to take more milk and add on extra weight. Piglets which are above 8 weeks old should not be allowed to suckle milk from their mother (this helps them gain weight and strength to fight diseases).

If there is a pig which has given birth within 3 days then farmers should adjust litter size to match the number of functioning teats or ability of the pig to produce milk. Farmers should move larger piglets to a foster female pig (this should be done before piglets are 3 days old). Farmers should make sure that piglets have received the first milk from their real mother before they are moved to another female pig.Female pigs can sometimes identify their own piglets from others using their smell and they may use this to refuse other piglets given to them which are not their own; to avoid this, farmers piglets should try hiding the smell of the piglets so that the mother cannot identify its young and this can be done by smearing all the piglets including her own piglets with a strong smelling substance like iodine or soaking all the piglets thoroughly in a salt solution.

If the wheat is for home consumption  it can be intercropped with  legumes which are planted after the first weeding in between the rows of wheat (this helps to keep new weeds under control).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed control","id":"a0r70000000SthGAAS","content":"Weeds compete with wheat for nutrients  water and light and they greatly reduce yield got from wheat. Wheat which is planted and growing uniformly discourages weeds from growing. Weeds which grow in the garden when wheat is still between 4 and 5 weeks will greatly reduce yield at harvest. Farmers can control weeds by hand weeding and proper crop rotation. Another way for farmers to fight weeds is to prepare seed beds early since this allows weeds to germinate with the first rains and when followed by a very shallow harrowing will greatly reduce the amount of weeds in the wheat crop.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop rotation","id":"a0r70000000SthHAAS","content":"Crop rotation is very useful in controlling weeds in wheat.

Ear rot disease attacks maize passing through holes made by pests like earworms, borers and birds when they are feeding. Maize suffering from earrot may be harmful to feed to birds like chicken. Signs of ear rot include pink and reddish colour on maize cobs and grains, maize cobs developing irregular discoloured areas on husks. The discoloured areas enlarge until the husks become completely dried although the maize plant is still green. If husks are removed the maize ears appear chaffy and discoloured with a white cotton-like growth between maize grains. Late in the season many small black things (fungi) form on maize grains and cobs. Maize cobs which are heavily affected by ear rot are light in weight.

The most common of these pests are spiny brown bugs and they are difficult to control because they move around alot in the field and they can attack coming from neighboring fields. Control: Farmers can use hands to pick young bugs from pigeon pea plants; bugs which are picked should be destroyed. Farmers can also use insect nets to collect adult bugs after which the bugs should be destroyed. Farmers should also not destroy ants and bugs in the field since these feed on the bugs. Farmers can also spray pigeon pea plants with mixtures made from plants like gum trees or pesticides which have neem extracts in them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWYAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"KAT 60","id":"a0r70000000StgrAAC","content":"This type of pigeon peas is called KAT 60/8. The seeds are white with brown spots and are smaller in size than those of other pigeon pea types. This type of pigeon peas grow in areas where temperatures are high and where height of land is between 0 and 1800 metres above sea level. The KAT 60/8 type of pigeon peas can be able to withstand diseases like fusarium wilt and leaf spot. This type of pigeon peas is usually attacked by pests like pod suckers and pod borers. KAT 60/8 pigeon peas mature between 135 to 150 days and if farmers plant 90kg per acre they can get between 5 to 7 yields in one season (or 13 for 2 seasons).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWZAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow blotches on leaves and black line on stem and leaf stalks","id":"a0r70000000StgsAAC","content":"If the sunflower plant has yellow blotches on leaves and black lines on the stem and leaf stalks  then it has been attacked by the Tobacco Streak Virus Disease (TSV). This disease additionally causes stunting  shortening of internodes  deformation of growing tip and wilting and death of young plants. Sometimes the central part of the stem (Pith) blackens. TSV is mainly transmitted in infected pollen by wind or Thrips. Use insecticides especially at seedling stage to control thrips and always remove weeds that may host the virus.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWbAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fertiliser UseGSPLIT:ukeywords.tmp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   GSplit Archive                                                                                      &{2909CA96-F846-426C-A5F5-70D3AB4BBBEF}                                                                                                                                                                                                                         EÊ     áG     ¹ò4    
