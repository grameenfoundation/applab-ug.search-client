Tomato seedlings which are 3 to 4 weeks old (and are 15 to 25 cm high with 3 to 5 true leaves) are ready for transplanting. Seedlings must be thoroughly watered 12 to 14 hours before they are lifted out of the seedbed, to avoid excessive damage to the roots. Farmers planning to transplant tomato seedlings should carry out the transplantingin the late afternoon to avoid seedlings getting excessively burnt (scorched) and damaged by the sun. A week before transplanting, watering done on the seedlings should be reduced so that they can harden. After transplanting, farmers should immediately water seedlings with atleast a cup of water per plant since this helps plants to quickly establish themselves in the soil.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting seeds directly","id":"a0r70000000StdzAAC","content":"Tomatoes can be planted and grown either by raising seedlings in a nursery bed and transplanting them to a field later or by directly planting tomato seeds in the field.

ACMD is one of the most serious and widespread diseases throughout cassava growing areas in Africa  causing yield reductions. It is caused by a complex of viruses and transmitted through infected cuttings and whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci). The best control measure is to plant resistant varieties and to use disease-free planting materials. If it is not possible to find completely disease free stems  select cuttings from stem branches instead of from the main stem. Stem cuttings from the branches are more likely to sprout into disease-free plants than stem cuttings from the main stems. Rogue off (uproot and destroy) infected plants during the early stage to reduce secondary spread. Intercrop with tall growing plants like maize to reduce vector movement and transmission of the disease.

CBB is caused by bacteria  Xanthomonas sp. As control  plant resistant or at least tolerant varieties. Plants infected at an early stage should be pruned to allow for new regrowth or uprooted entirely and burnt. If complete outbreaks on whole farms are observed  it may be necessary to harvest roots immediately and destroy stems and leaves and other plant debris through burning. Infected plant debris may also be ploughed deep into soil. In both situations the land must be allowed to fallow for few years (3 years minimum) before it is planted again to cassava. The bacterium responsible for the disease is unable to survive over a long period outside the host. In communities where land for peasant farming is scarce  fallowing of land may not be a good disease control option.  After destruction of infected plant debris as described in the preceding section  cereals  grains or legumes can be planted on the same piece of land. After three seasons the land can be returned to cassava. Farmers must consciously harvest stems from healthy plants completely free of any of the described symptoms of the disease (i.e. use clean planting materials). It is generally wise to avoid using planting materials from any farm suspected to be under CBBattack even if symptoms of the disease have not been observed on plants. Grasshoppers and other insects that can serve as carriers of the bacterium from farm to farm must be controlled using environmentally friendly measures. Tools used to cut infected plants should be cleaned after use to prevent spread of the bacterium. Crop rotation can help in controlling the spread of CBB. Destroy plant debris (remains).\n\nAttribution: IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sore-like sores on stem","id":"a0r70000000SteGAAS","content":"If cankers or sore-like sore appear on the stems; Cankers may develop cracks  exposing inner tissues of stems to the external environment.

Young and older parts of stems may bear cankers; Wilting observed in infected plants and this is often accompanied by defoliation; Dieback of stems is an important symptom of the disease and in some varieties entire infected stems may die back and break off  the disease is called Cassava anthracnose disease (CAD). CAD is caused by fungus Collectothricum gloeosporioides and transmitted by wind or rain splashes. The symptoms of the disease often start and develop rapidly inthe wet season. The most reliable control measure is to use desired anthracnose resistant varieties particularly in localities with high CAD pressures. In situations where desired varieties are susceptible to CAD  healthy stems free of cankers and dieback tissues must be selected to provide cuttings for new plantings. Stems and leaves from infected plants after harvest must be destroyed by burning to reduce the amount of fungal spores and other infective structures that can cause infections inthe next generation of plants.

Young plants are usually harvested in stages  while old plants are more commonly uprooted to prevent the storage roots becoming very fibrous. As cassava roots do not keep fresh more than 2-3 days after harvesting  not all plants are harvested at once  but rather harvesting as the roots are consumed. When cassava is grown for urban markets they are harvested in large amounts. Cassava is usually harvested 9-12 months after planting. It is sometimes harvested earlier if needed for food. Storage roots become too woody if harvesting is delayed. Early maturing varieties are ready for harvesting at 7 months while late maturing varieties are ready 12 months after planting.   Average yields are between 3-4 tons of fresh tubers per acre (7.5-10 tons per ha) although with reasonable care and attention yields of up to 10 tons per acre (25 tons per ha) and more are possible. The ratio of fresh tubers to peeled and dried chips is about 3:1. Cassava does not store well when fresh and therefore has to be peeled  chopped and dried in the sun. During post harvest cassava is peeled and cut into smaller pieces or grating and pressing into small balls before drying. To make flour   pound or grind in a mill the dry slices or balls. It can then be stored in the form of chips or flour under dry conditions.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"MM92 0067 Akena","id":"a0r70000000SteOAAS","content":"Carefully select varieties with multiple pest and disease resistance  high and stable root yields and acceptable quality characteristics that meet endusers? requirements.

Stakes taken from older plants are lignified and they perform poorly due to delayed sprouting and rooting. Cassava should be grown from semi-hardwood cuttings or the hard wood as long as it is not above 18 months. Over- matured and very young stems should be avoided. Over mature cuttings have dormant nodes  are lignified and have very little nutrients  while very young cuttings dehydrate easily and are susceptible to pathogens. In case of delay in planting  store cuttings in a dry  well-ventilated  shaded areas away from direct sunlight. Avoid thin stems as they have less nutrients and moisture resulting in weak sprouts that can produce only a few tuberous roots; very big stems are bulky. Medium stems are best. Use cuttings with about 5-7 nodes to increase spouting chances. Small cuttings lose viability and moisture very easily and that may affect spouting ability and establishment. Healthy stems should be used. Avoid bruising stems  as bruises can be entry points for pathogens. Diseased stems sprout poorly. It is important for the farmer to know the symptoms of most important diseases such as Cassava Brown Streak Disease (Cassava Brown streak Disease) and Cassava Mosaic Disease (Cassava Mossaic Disease) in order to select clean planting materials. Materials cut with well-sharpened machete  knife or saw have smooth edges that are not damaged. Avoid rough handling which may damage the epidermis or buds. Stems may be with an appropriate pesticide at planting. It is not common to treat planting materials but the following treatments may be used. Cut materials to planting size using a sharp machete. Average size cuttings are prepared to 20 ? 25 cm. Thinner cuttings are prepared to about 30 cm. Pre-sprout stem cuttings by placing hardwood or semi-mature stem cuttings in perforated polythene bags without soil. Fill each bag up to two-thirds leaving about one-third for aeration. Tie the bags with a piece of string and place in a shaded area or under a roof. Sprouting occurs in 3-5 days. Some varieties however  require a longer period for sprouting.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storage of excess planting material","id":"a0r70000000SteTAAS","content":"The stakes are vulnerable to adverse climatic conditions  pests  and diseases.

Cone shaped feeders are usually between 35to 45 cm in diameter and can contain up to between 15 to 25 kg of feeds which is enough for about 50 to 80 broilers if 2 or 3 conical feeders are used in a chicken house. Farmers should make sure that they place some drinking water for the chicken atleast 3 meters from the feeders. It is important for the chicken to have enough feeding space;  allow 4 cm for every adult chicken if cone shaped feeders are being used. If horizontal feeding troughs are being used more space is required; broilers between 0 and 2 weeks should have space of 1.5 cm for each chicken, broilers between 3 and 4 weeks should have space of 2.5 cm for each chicken while broilers between 5 and 8 weeks should have space of 5 cm for each bird if horizontal feeding troughs are being used.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StP5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Amount of water needed","id":"a0r70000000StQfAAK","content":"It is very important for broiler chicken to be provided with fresh, clean water to drink at all times; a broiler will drink between 2 and 3 litres of water for each kg of feeds it eats but if room temperatures are high then the amount of water taken by each bird will increase.

NOTE: It is best for farmers to first get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on whether it is necessary to apply chemical fertilisers in their gardens, which fertilisers to use and how to apply them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of bananas not getting enough soil nutrients","id":"a0r70000000StisAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Erosion Control","id":"a0r70000000StitAAC","content":"Soil erosion occurs when water carries away top soil which is fertile and is needed for bananas to grow well and give high yields at harvest. Soil erosion also exposes plant roots and this may make banana plants fall down. Soil erosion can be controlled by reducing the speed of running water by making trenches that are 2 feet deep and 2 feet wide across the garden. The soil from the trench should be heaped on the upper side of the trench and supported with sticks and grass to prevent it from falling back into the trench. Soil erosion can also be controlled by mulching the plantation with dry grass or intercropping with other crops like beans. Mulch should atleast be 1 inch deep but if grass is available mulch of up to half a foot deep can be used. A distance of between 2 to 3 feet should be left from the banana plant to the mulch. Avoid turning the mulch during weeding since this will make it rot very fast which reduces its ability to control soil erosion and may also damage banana roots. Beans and other crops that are intercropped with bananas should be planted atleast 2 to 3 feet from the banana plant and shallow planting holes should be made for these crops to avoid damaging banana plant roots.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Providing support for banana plants","id":"a0r70000000StiuAAC","content":"When banana plants start producing banana bunches it may be necessary to provide support to the banana plants (this is called propping).

Banana plants need propping especially during the dry season  when there are strong winds or when banana gardensare attacked by pests (like nematodes and weevils) because such conditions make banana plants weak and more likely to fall over. Farmers should use 1 or 2 strong pieces of wood to provide support to banana plants that have banana bunches and this will protect banana plants from falling down. The best types of wood to use for propping are tree branches that have a natural fork on them.

TEACHING CALVES HOW TO FEED FROM A BUCKET: Put 2 fingers in the calf's mouth sothat it starts to suck, gently lower the calf's mouth into the colostrum (first milk the cow produces) that has ben milked into a bucket, slowly remove the fingers from the calf's mouth and the calf will start drinking from the bucket. ADVANTAGES of artificial feeding include being easy for farmers to control the amount of milk given to the calf and to keep records of each calf's consumption. It also makes it easier for farmers to teach calves how to feed, calves can feed in a quiet place without any disturbance and it also makes it possible to record and monitor how much milk a cow is producing. Also when artificial feeding is being used and a calf dies or is taken away the cow's milk production will not be affected. WARNING: Farmers should never give calves too much milk because this can cause diarrhea or dysentery (if this occurs the amount of milk being given to the calf should be reduced by half and should be mixed with an equal amount of water). Milk should be given to a calf immediately after milking when the milk is still at the body temperature of the cow. Farmers should observe cleanliness and hygiene (all equipment used to handle milk should be clean) to protect calves from diseases. After 3 weeks farmers should start providing clean water for the claves at all times.

First symptoms of the disease include small dark brown spots with straight edges (when conditions are wet a grey growth (mould) develops on the lower surface of the spots). These spots increase in size, join together and cause yellowing and death of affected parts and this may cause leaves to drop offwhen they are still young. Stems and pods on bean plants which are infected may also develop reddish brown spots.\nPrevention and Control: Farmers can prevent this disease by planting seeds which are free from angular leaf spot, practising a 2 to 3 year rotation of crops and adding organic manure (not factory made) to the soil to improve soil fertility. Farmers can control angular leaf spot by ploughing into the soil all parts of bean plants which are left behind after harvest. Farmers should also avoid moving around and working in bean gardens which are wet. Farmers can treat beans affected with angular leaf spot using chemicals like Dithane M45 or Benlate.

Bruchids are small beetles with a grey, brown or reddish brown colour which lay eggs on the bean seeds. The young ones of bruchids enter bean seeds and grow from inside for about 1 month where they feed on, damage and reduce ability of bean seeds to germinate. Adult bruchids come out of the bean seeds leaving small holes on the bean seeds. If beans are attacked by a lot of bruchids then many of the bean seeds will have holes on them and adult bruchids may be seen moving in the stored beans. Bruchids can sometimes also attack beans which are still in the garden and here they lay eggs on bean pods which are ripening.\n\nPrevention and Control: Farmers must dry beans in the sun before storing them. Before storing beans farmers can prevent bruchids by mixing bean seeds with things like vegetable oil (coconut or cotton seed oil mixed at a rate of about 5 ml of oil per kg of beans) or plant parts (neem or pyrethrum). If a small amount of beans is to be stored then daily turning of the container in which they are stored can reduce attacks from bruchids. The most effective way of fighting bruchids is keeping beans in clean containers and in a clean store. Old infected beans which remained from last season?s harvest must be removed from the store before new beans are stored.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StW4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small holes and yellow spots on leaves stems swelling and breaking","id":"a0r70000000Stf4AAC","content":"These pests are called bean flies or bean stem maggots. The adult bean fly is a small fly with a shiny black and bluish colour. Bean flies make holes on leaves in which they feed and lay eggs and this makes bean leaves develop yellow spots which is one of the first signs that beans have been attacked by bean flies. Young ones (maggots) of bean flies make holes through bean leaves until they reach lower parts of bean stems where they eat and destroy internal parts of bean plants making the stems become swollen, break up and also reducing on the number of roots which spread out in the soil. When attacked stems start breaking up, young ones of bean flies (which may be yellow, brown or black in colour) may be seen inside the stem and attacked bean plants may start developing roots on their stems. Young bean plants and those which are not getting enough nutrients may dry up and die if they are attacked by bean flies while older bean plants or those which are getting enough nutrients may survive an attack from bean flies but they will not grow well and will produce very few beans. Bean plants which are growing on infertile soil or are not getting enough water can be badly damaged by bean flies.\nPrevention and Control: Farmers should plant beans early since bean flies are usually few in the early parts of the growing season. Beans should also not be planted near cowpeas, soybeans or any other legumes which may be having bean flies. Farmers can also prevent bean fly attacks by providing good conditions for the beans to grow in (this can be done by mulching and adding organic fertilizers or well decomposed farmyard manure to the soil). To control bean flies, farmers should remove and destroy remaining parts of bean plants which show signs of having bean flies.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mbarara Kasese road","id":"a0r70000000SuICAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Liberation road","id":"a0r70000000SuIDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Customs road","id":"a0r70000000SuIEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Taxi Park","id":"a0r70000000SuIFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Naboa road","id":"a0r70000000SuIGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bunghoko Sub county","id":"a0r70000000SuIHAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bamuluya trading centre","id":"a0r70000000SuIIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"St Andrews Cathedral","id":"a0r70000000SuIJAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kumi road","id":"a0r70000000SuIKAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Manafa road","id":"a0r70000000SuILAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bishop Wasike road","id":"a0r70000000SuIMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"St Pauls College","id":"a0r70000000SuINAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Republic Street","id":"a0r70000000SuIOAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pabbo trading centre","id":"a0r70000000SuIPAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Anaka trading center","id":"a0r70000000SuIQAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Reducing leaves on banana plants","id":"a0r70000000StivAAC","content":"Farmers should regularly reduce the number of leaves on banana plants in order to keep banana plants healthy and free from pests and diseases.

They are small, very mobile insects that are white and first and later on develop a brown or pale yellow color. Farmers can separate onion leaves and look carefully if they want to see the thrips and the damage they cause on onion leaves. SIGNS: Thrips make small holes on the upper surface of onion leaves and feed on the plant sap especially from leaves that are just developing deep inside the onion plant; this results in leaves having white and silvery patches. If too many thrips attack an onion plant the tips of leaves on the plant will turn brownish, growth of the plant will slow down, leaves and the onions developing on the plant will lose their normal shape and the onions developing on the plant will reduce in size. Although thrips cause most damage when they attack onions plants that are in the early bulbing stage (forming onions on the plant), farmers should always try to control thrips before the plants reach this stage so that thrips in the garden do not become too many since these are hard to control. Thrips that attack onion plants towards harvesting time (even if the thrips are many) cause little damage since at this stage the onion plants can tolerate thrip attacks. Thrip attacks are usually more serious during dry seasons and at such times whole onion gardens can be destroyed by these pests. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers can prevent thrips from attacking their onion gardens by keeping them well irrigated (dry onion plants are more likely to get attacked by thrips than well watered ones). Weeds and onion plants that are attacked by too many thrips should be removed from the garden.  Thrips can be controlled by spraying affected plants with locally made neem pesticides but farmers MUST get advice from agricultural personnel in the area because some neem pesticides can be harmful to onions that are still growing.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StPrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Natural feeding","id":"a0r70000000StQvAAK","content":"This involves allowing calves tosuckle (take milk) directly from their mother's teats.

fly maggots White or cream maggots on lower part of stem blueish leaves which later dry up whole onion plants drying up and sometimes dying","id":"a0r70000000Stj8AAC","content":"This is caused by onion flies (brownish grey flies that are smaller than ordinary house flies); the flies lay eggs in soil from which maggots develop and greatly damage onion plants as they feed. Young ones of onion flies (maggots) are major pests for onions. Onion fly maggots are small (about 0.8 cm when they are fully grown) and are white to cream in color. They feed on onion roots that branch off from the main root from which they enter the main root and make holes inside it and sometimes they can even reach the lower part of the stem. Leaves on onion plants that are affected will dry up and turn abit blue incolor; the plants dry up, reduce in size and may eventually die. Onion fly maggots can kill seedlings by feeding just above the lower parts of the seedlings; a maggot can attack several seedlings one after the other and this causes poor plant establishment resulting in many gaps in the garden. Onion fly maggots are also found inside onions developing on the affected plant. As the onion fly maggots feed, they expose the plant to diseases like bacterial soft rot. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should avoid planting onions in soil that has alot of organic matter that is not yet well rotted (such as soil on which animals have just been grazing) and soil that has alot of weeds. Onion flies usually lay their eggs in soil that is wet, and contains a high amount of organic matter (manure and left over plant material).  Farmers should not plant onions in a garden unless the left over plant material is dry and completely rotten. If animal manure is being used as a fertiliser then farmers shouldallow enough time for the manure to rot and break down before they plant onions. Onions should also not be planted in a garden season after season; farmers should practice crop rotation with crops that are not in the onion family (crops like garlic should not be used in the rotation). Onion gardens should be kept well separated and onions grown in a season following an attack from onion fly maggots should be planted as far away as possible from the soil on which the affected onions were growingin the previous season. All onion plants that are affected by onion fly maggots should be removed from the garden and destroyed (by burning). To prevent onion flies farmers should carefully plough (dig into the soil) plant remains immediately after harvesting is done and the soil should be regularly dug and turned so that young ones of onion flies can be Turn soil to killed. Farmers can also place powdered hot pepper or ginger around onion stems since this helps control the numbers of onion flies in an onion garden. Locally made pesticides made from neem products can also help prevent onion flies from laying eggs in onion gardens if they are sprayed on the onions and soil.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaf miners Rotting on parts where leaves start from and white or yellow lines developing on leaves curling and loss of normal leaf shape and plants rotting","id":"a0r70000000Stj9AAC","content":"This is caused by pests called leaf miners; damage cause by leaf miners is usually not serious (may only make onions lose their healthy appearance and may make them rejected at the market) and they do not affect growth of onions.

As the rot progresses the affected fleshy onion scales become soft; and farmers can identify onions that have been affected by the disease by pressing on the onion bulb (bulbs that are softer than normal are diseased). Squeezing necks of affected onion bulbs will make them release a watery, bad smelling liquid. Bacterial soft rot usually attacks onions that have been damaged (have wounds) or onions that have been attacked by onion maggots (these cause the disease as they feed); onions with mechanical injuries, bruises or sunscald can easily be affected by bacterial soft rot especially when conditions are  warm and wet.

After 3 to 4 weeks, leaves of affected onion plants start turning yellow and collapse. Onion bulbs (the onions that have developed on a plant) may also be attacked, mainly at the neck and signs of this are yellowish to reddish watery rotting parts.\nPREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should practice early planting and when planting they should use seeds of onion types that have waxy leaves since they are more resistant to disease than onion types that have glossy (smooth and shiny) leaves. Farmers should also increase the amount of ploughing they do between seasons since this helps reduce purple blotch disease, spacing left between onion plants should also be increased. Other good practices farmers can carry out to prevent purple blotch disease in onions include treating seeds before they are planted, carrying out crop rotation, removing remains of onions plants after harvest and planting onions in soil that is well drained.  If the disease has greatly attacked a big onion garden then farmers may be advised to spray their onion plantswith fungicides (advice must be got from agricultural personnel in the area on which fungicide to use and how to use it).

Sorghum is best stored in airtight containers (like drums or tins) or clean sacks and it should be kept in a clean place that is well ventilated (enough air enters and leaves freely).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:38\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When and how to harvest","id":"a0r70000000Stl3AAC","content":"Sorghum is usually ready for harvesting in about 3 months from the time it is planted; sorghum should only be harvested when it has become dry (when the sorghum grain does not produce any liquid when it is crushed), when the the seeds have attained their real color (red) or when a black color has started showing at the tip of the grain.

PREVENTION and CONTROL: After harvesting, all left over parts of sorghum plants should be collected and destroyed. Farmers should plant sorghum types that are resistant to damage from shoot flies. Planting should be done early so that sorghum can grow and reach a stage at which it can survive damage by the time shoot flies attack.  Uniform sowing of the same variety over large areas with the onset of rains reduces the damage by sorghum shoot fly. Applying fertiliser helps sorghum crops to grow strongly which makes them able to survive shoot fly attacks; cattle manure should not be used to fertilise sorghum gardens because it attracts shoot flies.

insects that can be seen on affected groundnut plants collecting together on young parts of the plants (like on new leaves). While aphids are feeding on groundnut plants theycan spread diseases (like groundnut rosette disease) and they also reduce the amount of yield that can be harvested especially if they attack during the dry season. SIGNS: Groups of small dark insects collected in groups on young parts of groundnut plants is a sign that aphids have attacked. Young leaves under shich aphids are hiding may also become curled (roll up) but farmers will be able  to see the aphids if they open up these leaves. Another sign of aphids is if groundnut plants are growingslower than normal and if their leaves and stems lose their normal shape. Presence of many ants on the groundnut plants is also a sign that groundnut crops are affected by aphids. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that can withstand aphids (groundnut types Nyanda, Serenut 2 and Igora 1). Farmers should also carry out early planting and avoid leaving wide spaces between groundnut plants; early planting (planting when the rains have just begun) helps groundnuts to growup quickly and flower before aphids attack while using the correct spacing between groundnut plants (not leaving very wide spaces between them) prevents aphids from coming into the garden coming from the edges of the garden, it prevents numbers of aphids from increasing in the garden and prevents groundnut diseases spread by aphids from breaking out in the groundnuts being grown.

Crops that are good to include in a rotaion with groundnuts include maize , sorghum, millet as well as crops that are able to control weeds (like cassava , sweet potato and sunflower).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Time of planting","id":"a0r70000000StjnAAC","content":"It is hard to come to a standard planting date for planting under the current weather conditions in Uganda BUT farmers should plant as soon as the rains have started to make sure that the planted groundnuts germinate well.  In general, groundnuts are usually planted between mid February and mid April during the first season and in early August for the second season. Planting early in the season helps to increase the amount of groundnuts harvested,improve seed quality of groundnuts harvested and reduces cases of groundnut diseases like rosette disease. Groundnut types that take long to mature (like Igola 1 and Serenut 1R) should only be planted with the first rains in the first season. Groundnut types that take a short time to mature (like Serenut 3R and Serenut 4T) can be planted in any season.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Depth of planting","id":"a0r70000000StjoAAC","content":"When planting, groundnut seeds should be placed at a depth of between 5 to 6 cm. It is vey important for farmers to plant groundnuts in rows and following the recommended spacing becausethis helps prevent diseases diseases (like rosette disease), reduces problems of weeds, ensures that groundnut pods grow uniformly and that a good quality harvest is got. Groundnut seeds should not be planted very close to each other because this will result in plants having few pods growing on them. Planting groundnut seeds with very wide spaces between them will give the farmer few groundnuts at harvest time. Overall,  planting seeds at the recommended depth and spacing makes sure that the groundnut pods growing on the plants are of the same age and stage of development which makes it easier for the farmer to decide when to harvest.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Seed spacing","id":"a0r70000000StjpAAC","content":"When planting groundnuts, farmers should follow the recommended spacing because this helps to make sure that the number of crops planted is enough and can be supported by the land on which they are planted.

Farmers can reduce the space left between rows from 45 cm to 30 cm  if they want and this can help the planted groundnut crops to cover the soil quickly and help prevent serious problems with weeds.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Seed dressing","id":"a0r70000000StjqAAC","content":"Seed dressing meanstreating the seeds with chemicals before they are planted; this is done to prevent and control diseases that may attack groundnut seedlings and to also keep away pests that may attack the seeds when they are planted. Groundnut seeds bought from agricultural stockists are usually already dressed but farmers can decide to do the seed dressing themselves (especially if they plan to plant their own seeds or those got from other farmers). Seed dressing can be done by mixing Thiram dust uniformly in the groundnut seeds before planting is done; about 120 gm of Thiram dust are needed for every 100 kgs of groundnut seeds. Thiram dust can be bought from certified agricultural stockists and farm input suppliers.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

Between 10 to 15 people are needed to harvest 1 acre of irish potatoes. Farmers should also set aside some money to buy pesticides and fungicides in case diseases and pests attack the crops (about 1 to 2 kg of fungicides can be enough to spray an acre at once).

The disease is caused when substrates (material in which the mushrooms are grown) become dirty. Substrates may become dirty when they are steamed (cooked) for a shorter time, if little fire is used to heat water used in the steaming or if the substrate is handled with dirty hands or equipment after it is steamed. SIGNS: Green spots on the surface of the material on which mushrooms are being grown; these green things prevent mushroom seeds from growing through the substrate and eventually the whole mushroom garden may be covered with this green substance. CONTROL: The most important way of preventing green mould is by keeping everything used in mushroom growing clean. Farmers should make sure that the substrate is steamed over a continuous fire for about 4 to 5 hours and the substrate should be handled with clean, disinfected hands and equipment after it has cooled down. The bags in which the substrate is packed should be clean and should be tied very well and kept in a clean place after the substrate is packed into them. Farmers should clean their hands before toucching the bags in which mushrooms are to be planted. Mushroom seeds that have green spots should not be planted and bags that have green spots on them should be removed from the mushroom house and kept in a separate place to prevent the disease from passing on to other bags in the house.\n\nAttribution: Inromation provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXSAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Marketing harvested mushrooms","id":"a0r70000000StjyAAC","content":"Farmers planning to sell fresh mushrooms should look for market before they even plant the mushrooms; if this is not done then farmers may fail to get a market quickly which will make the mushrooms get spoilt leading to heavy losses.

Apply when the pineapple plants have fully established in the soil and during rain season. Cow dung should be applied when it is dry and not fresh. Chicken litter is most ideal and is best applied when it has undergone decomposition. Coffee husks are more readily available and double as mulch when applied. A 10cm depth of the husks application in the double rows will suffice for the whole growth period until fruit maturity. Additionally apply 75 -83 kg/ acre of rock phosphate as a fertilizer. Apply fertilizers and manures in the same rates at every ratoon crop. Intercropping pineapples with beans, ground nuts or peas will also help fix nitrogen for pineapples. Addition of magnesium also increases fruit weight.

Spacing depends on whether farmers are going to grow pineapples alone or with other crops. Individual plants are placed 1ft (30cm) apart, and space between plants in a row is 2 ft. This spacing gives a smaller number of pineapples at harvest but gives bigger sized fruits; this type of spacing is also good for fertile soils. Farmers that want smaller sized fruits (for export) can use another type of spacing where 1 ft is left between plants in a row, 1 ft is left between the pineapple rows and 4 ft are left between the double rows.  Also a spacing of 1ft (30cm) apart, 1ft (30cm) between the plants and 4ft (120cm) between the double rows can be used.

In Thika these take 25-28 months to come into bearing, but have uniform growth and are less susceptible to to premature fruiting. Slips; These are leafy shoot growth arising from the fruit stalks, they take 22-24 months to come into bearing. Suckers; They are leafy shoot growth from the base of the plant where the roots grow. They give the highest yield, but have a long harvest duration. They are also more difficult to plant. Suckers take 18-22 months to come into bearing. To achieve uniform plant growth, selection and sizing of planting material is of major importance. All planting material can be stored upside down in the shade for up to three months and then planted in loose friable dry or preirrigated soil. Only totally healthy and if possible large shoots should be chosen, in order to ensure a uniform crop. Slips can also tolerate dryness, yet not as well as the suckers as they are generally lighter in weight. Slips vary much in size making grading in sizes necessary in order to have uniform plantings. Planting is normally done at the beginning of the long rains. As soon as the plantation begins to produce fruit, any harvested plants should be removed and cut up before being spread over the soil. The plantation will also need to be thinned out from time to time, because suckers, which continually develop, may limit the amount of room available for each individual plant. When all possible niches are already occupied with plants, weeds will have littlechance of gaining a foothold, and can also easily be uprooted by hand. Mature weeds can be cut down with a knife or pulled out and then cut up to be used for mulch material.

Proper land preparation is extremely important for the development of the roots. Poor land preparation result in poor yields. Perennial weeds should be cleared by repeated deep cultivations during the dry season. Uproot weeds, allow themto dry, harrow into strips and burn them. In areas where the soils have high clay content, it is essential to plough also during the dry season to facilitate root penetration of pineapples. Plough to a depth of 45 cm, or if using hand digging, dig as deep as possible. After ploughing, use a disc harrow to produce a fine tilth. Small-scale growers can uproot old pineapple plants by hand, while large growers can use a large harrow to uproot and chop the stumps and leaves. Nitrogen is essential tothe increase of fruit size and total yield. Five to 10 tons of manure per hectare applied to the field before mulching and planting will increase eventual yields. A general application of 180 to 200 kg/ ha of rock phosphate should be added at the same time. Each ratoon crop will again need a new supply of nutrients and will benefit from compost as well as rock phosphate at the same rate. To avoid infection by dry-rot fungus  all of the shoots should be stored in a shady place for wounds to healand suberise quickly.

Late leaf spot occurs later in the season and does not cause big losses at harvest like early leaf spot does. SIGNS: Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by early leaf spot will have dark brown spots surrounded by a yellow circle (the spots will be light brown on the lower side of leaves). Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by late leaf spot will have darkers spots with no (or a very light) yellow circle surrounding them; strong attacks of late leaf spot will make leaves fall off the groundnut plant which makes it grow old before the right time. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that are resistant to diseases (especially types like Serenut 2 and Igora 1).

Ginger plants having signs of soft rot should be removed from the garden and burnt.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MUK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:38\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nutrients and fertiliser requirements","id":"a0r70000000StkiAAC","content":"Ginger needs alot of nutrient to grow well and this is the reason why farmers are advised to grow ginger in a newly cultivated field; ginger should not be grown in a field for two consecutive seasons (one season after another).

Then wash the fermented seeds in clean water and remove any floating seeds as they are of a poor quality. Then dry the seeds in indirect light and in well-ventilated places. These can be sown or stored in a waterproof container for up to 2 years. Always look out for any mould while in store and dry again if beginning to develop mould.

This means farmers should plan carefully according to the locations of their tree plantations. Firebreaks can be made either manually (clearing vegetation through digging and slashing to ground level) or through controlled burning. Manual clearing is expensive and is not recommended on steep slopes as it will lead to erosion. Controlled burning is usually the best method of preparing firebreaks and it should be carried out when the sorroundingvegetation is still green. When carrying out controlled burning, a useful technique is to spray a line of Glyphosate which is 1 metre wide on either side of the firebreak to be made (this spraying should be done when the firebreak and sorrounding vegetation is still green). As soon as the sprayed lines have dried, vegetation in the sprayed lines can be burnt off safely. Once the vegetation found in between the sprayed lines has dried off naturally it can also be burnt off since the cleared lines on either side prevent the fire from spreading to other places. Whenever controlled burning is being done people should be ready with fire fighting equipment in case conditions change or the fire jumps to another area. Farmers should also never carry out any burning when conditions are dangerous (when it is too hot or vegetation around is too dry). In areas where vegetation does not dry off naturally, firebreaks can be made by slashing vegetation but the slashing should be done as close to theground as possible.The slashed vegetation should be left to dry and then it should be collected in the middle of the firebreak and it should be burnt when it is safe to burn and before the fire season starts.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:32\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sts9AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"filling","id":"a0r70000000StsMAAS","content":"Cotton will germinate in 7 to 10 days.

In some cases one vaccine can protect against 2 or more diseases (such as the combined vaccine for anthrax and black-quarter diseases). Vaccines are not available for all diseases but those vaccines that are available provide a cheaper way of controlling diseases, avoiding illness, preventing losses in production, preventing death and help save on cost of providing treatment for sick cattle. Infact some diseases (like foot and mouth) haveno exact treatment available but only have vaccines available to help prevent those diseases. Some vaccines need to be given once in the life of the animal while others need to be repeated regularly (usually once a year). How vaccination is done: Most vaccines need to be stored in a refrigerator to keep cool because exposing them to high temperatures can make them ineffective. All vaccination should be done with the help of a veterinary doctor or a trained person and only healthy animals (freefrom signs of worm infestation) should be vaccinated. Cows in late pregnancy or that have just given birth should not be vaccinated. If different vaccines for different diseases are to be given to the same animal then an interval of atleast 1 month should be left between each vaccine given.�\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to stop calves from taking milk","id":"a0r70000000StPQAA0","content":"Weaning (stopping calves from feeding on milk) should be done when they are 3 months old (at this age they should  weigh between 60 to 80 kg).

Farmers should only help if the calf has come out in the normal position but the cow is having difficulty in pushing it out; for all other problems that occur farmers are advised to get help from veterinary personnel in their area or people that have experience in helping cows that are giving birth.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMlAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Normal birth of calves","id":"a0r70000000StPWAA0","content":"Calves being born normally come out with their front legs first followed by the head and the rest of the body; the front feet that appear first face down towards the ground (if the feet that come out firstare facing up then it is likely that the hind feet have come out first).

By about five years from the time of planting  the farmer should leave 10 large or 15 medium sized shade trees in each hectare.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by FAO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making very old cocoa plants to grow afresh","id":"a0r70000000StnEAAS","content":"When cocoa plants grow old  their productivity reduces.

Weaning (stopping calf from taking milk and giving it other types of food) should be done slowly to avoid causing stress to the calf. Calves that weigh below 60 kg when they are 12 weeks old should continue being fed on milk. At weaning, the calf should be provided with plenty of fresh good quality pasture half of which should be legumes like callinadra, leucaena, lablab and mucuna since calves require a lot of proteins (farmers can seek help from agricultural personnel in their area on identifying these legumes). In addition to the plenty of pasture, calves at this age should be given between 1and 2 kg of mixed feeds per day (mixed feeds are factory made food for animals that can be got from shops selling animal feeds); if farmers cannot provide mixed feeds then they should increase the amount of legumes they are giving the calves.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNLAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General calf management","id":"a0r70000000StPzAAK","content":"It is important to provide a lot of care for the calves since they are easily affected by diseases and problems that come from calves not getting enough nutrients.

There are cases where the hind feet show first when a calf is being born (this will be seen if the feet appear upside down as they come out); and when this happens the farmer will need to give help to the cow as it gives birth. When the hind legs show first, the farmer should wait until the feet have come out from the cow?s vulva and then they should start pulling the legs gently at the same time as the cow pushes (the person pulling should first wait and feel the cow pushing then they should gently pull the calf out; they should stop pulling when the cow stops pushing and carry on pulling when it starts pushing again). Once the hind quarter of the calf is out (and only the upper part is left inside the cow) farmers should make sure that the calf gets out quickly. Other abnormal ways in which a calf being born may come out of the cow include the tail showing first, twisted neck, one leg showing first and the farmer should quickly get help from a veterinary doctor in such any of these cases occur.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of a cow about to give birth","id":"a0r70000000StQ1AAK","content":"Between 1 and 2 weeks before giving birth, the cow's vulva swells, the udder becomes large, firm, full and may start producing a thick milky substance. On the day of giving birth, the cow separates itself from the rest of the herd, holds its tail high and off the vulva opening, becomes restless and a clear mucus substance may begin to flow from the vulva. At the actual time of giving birth, the water sac which contains the unborn calf appears and the front feet of the calf appear after the water sac breaks.  During the process of giving birth the cow should be left to produce the calf on its own for atleast 12 hours before farmers come in to try and offer any help.  When the calf is born farmers should remove the mucus from the mouth and nostrils of the calf and let the mother ofthe calf lick the mucus from the rest of the calf's body. The calf's umbilical chord should be cut with a sharp, clean (preferably new) blade and then it should be dipped in iodine solution (this can be got from an animal clinic). If the newborn calf is having difficulty in breathing then the farmer should scratch its nose using a dry piece of grass, hold its hind legs and swing it gently forward and backward or pour cold water on its nose to make it sneeze.\n\nAttribution: Information providedby EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparing for birth of calves","id":"a0r70000000StQ2AAK","content":"The gestation period of a cow will last between 274 and 291 days (9 months).

At theentrance of the dip tank a foot bath helps to remove soil from the feet of the animals so that it does not contaminate the chemical in the dip tank. Foot baths are also put at the gate of the farm for visitors entering the farm to disinfect their feet before entering the farm; foot baths help to kill parasites and disease causing organisms that the animals or visitors may be caring on their feet. Use of foot baths also helps to control foot rot by killing the bacteria that cattle may have on their feet. Foot baths should be at least 2 metres in length and 0.15 metres deep.

The area in which cows give birth should be easy to clean and disinfect thoroughly.

Coccidiosis can kill a large number of chicken before it is identified (this means the disease can attack and kill birds before showing any major signs). Coccidiosis is common in chicken that are being kept under a deep litter system and when the disease breaks out it usually spreads quickly (because birds are always in contact with litter which may have droppings that have the disease) so farmers must do all they can to prevent the disease from breaking out. SIGNS: Affected chicken lose appetite and look dull and weak; sometimes the chicken may also pass out blood stained droppings. The disease also causes a high number of deaths in young chicken and when dead birds are cut open their intestines will be swollen. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure chicks, feed and water are kept away from chicken droppings; chicken should not be overcrowded in the house in which they are being kept. Litter used in the chicken house should be kept dry, turned regularly and any wet areas in it should be removed and replaced with dry litter. If coccidiosis breaks out farmers must immediately remove birds that show signs of the disease and should start treating them immediately. There are drugs (called anticoccidials or coccidiostats) that farmers can mix in chicken feeds to help reduce levels of infection when coccidiocis breaks out (chicken that are to be slaughtered should not be given these drugs atleast 4 days before they are killed to  avoid drugs staying inside the carcass). Chicken with coccidiocis can also be treated by giving them drinking water in which Amprollium has been mixed (farmers MUST always seek advice from veterinary personnel on which drugs to use, amounts to use and how to mix the drugs).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StP1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Vaccination","id":"a0r70000000StP2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Keeping records of chicken","id":"a0r70000000StP3AAK","content":"It is very important for farmers to keep information on the broiler chicken they are keeping; this is called record keeping.

Farmers should turn the litter regularly (using a hoe, shovel or garden rake) so that it remains dry and does not become hard (it should be easy to break up into small bits when it is held in the hands). If litter in a chicken house is not looked after well it will develop a hard surface layer which can give broilers problems like breast blisters (when the birds rest down on hard litter the area around their breasts is bruised and develops wounds which later become hard; this lowers the quality of meat got from the broilers.

Curling or twisting, wrinkling, orfolding of young leaves, yellowish spotting and colouring of older leaves, and may lead to stunting (failure to increase in size) and wilting (plants bend and are stiff looking lifeless) of plants. Growth of sooty mould on honeydew released by aphids affects fruit quality.Control is by checking the crop regularly, whenever necessary spray only affected plants using natural pesticides that are not harmful to natural enemies (for instance neem, ashes, soapy water). Neem products keep away the aphids and have been effective in reducing numbers of aphids on pepper at 10 days intervals.  Chemicals like Dudu-Acelamectin can also be used.Please follow manufacturers instructions when using these chemicals\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYSAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Make small holes in leaves and cut stems of young seedlings at the base","id":"a0r70000000StmUAAS","content":"These are black cutworms.

Appears as circular spots/dots on leaves. The spots/dots are at first brown, later turning white with sunken centres and reddish margins. The symptoms can appear on stems but have not been seen on fruit. Spots on leaves are brown and circular with small to large grey centres and dark brown margins.  Wounds may be many causing leaves to turn yellow, then brown and drop.Infected leaves are dropped off the plant. General loss of leaves occurs under severe disease pressure. Fruits are not attacked. The fungus survives on seeds and in crop wastes. The disease is favoured by long periods of rain. Control is by Planting resistant cultivars if available,use of certified disease-free seeds and practicing good field sanitation. Avoid watering the plants.Water only around the roots. Avoid establishing seedbeds near tomato or pepper fields.It can be easily controlled by fungicides applied on leaves like Indofil M-45.\nPlease follow the manufacturers advice when using these

can also be fed using using buckets; bucket feeding helps farmers to control the amount of milk calves are taking each day (which prevents diseases like scours) and is also helpful when a cow dies and leaves calves behind.  It may not be easy to train calves how to drink from a bucket so it is important to start early. The first few days of bucket feeding are the most important so farmers should make sure that the calf gets enough milk at this time. Bucket feeding should be started when calves are between 2 to 3 days old. Farmers should keep weighing calves because this helps them know how much milk to give the calves at different stages. In the first 2 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/10 of their body weight and feeding should be done 3 times a day. In the next 3 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/5 of their body weight and feeding should be done 2 times a day. After 5 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/20 of their body weight until they are weaned and feeding should be done 2 times a day. Calves should be fed at the same time each day and milk should be given to calves immediately after it has been milked.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:15:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su9lAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Animal advice","id":"a0r70000000Su0SAAS","content":"Moses Tella Chemusto 0779465546.

Male rabbits have a small upwards swelling while female rabbits have a small opening. The process of sexing is easier to do by two people with one holding the rabbit while the other person finds out the sex of the rabbit. Young rabbits usually lie very still when laid on their backs.

Farmers should also deworm young rabbits 1 week after weaning them (deworming can be done with 1/4ml of Albendazole administered by mouth with a small syringe (without needle)for each 1 month old rabbit). When deworming the syringe should not be pushed too far into the rabbits mouth since this may damage their throats.

Maize smut disease is common in dry, hot maize growing areas as well as mid hill areas with weather that is neither too hot or too cold. Signs of maize smut include maize cobs becoming swollen and with an abnormal shape, male flowers growing too big and abnormal in shape, black masses of powdery things developing inside male flowers and in the place of normal maize cobs. Maize cobs affected by maize smut disease may not develop any maize grains on the cob. Prevention and control: The best, easiest and cheapest way a farmer can fight maize smut disease is planting seed types which resist maize smut. Farmers should also remove the abnormal swellings from diseased maize plants as soon as they are seen but it may be best to completely remove the whole maize plant which is affected. When digging farmers should be careful not to make any cuts on maize plants and they should fight any pests since smut enters through cuts on the maize plant or holes left by pests. Other ways to control smut include crop rotation, keeping maize fields clean, removing and destroying smut swellings on maize plants immediately they are seen (this helps to reduce presence of the disease in the next season).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves having grey greenish long spots that look like cigarettes","id":"a0r70000000StZZAA0","content":"This disease is called turcicum leaf blight and it often occurs in areas which usually have heavy, frequent rain, high humidity and low temperature during maize growing seasons. Damage to maize may be serious if the disease occurs before or at flowering stage, before or at silking stage or if conditions that favor the disease are present. Signs of turcicum leaf blight include slightly oval water-soaked small spots produced on leaves. The spots are dark and greyish-green in colour and as time goes on they become bigger and long shaped like cigarettes. They may appear first on lower leaves and increase in number as maize plants develop and the spots may join and form large areas which can kill maize leaves. Heavily infected leaves appear dry as if affected by drought. Prevention and control: To control the disease, farmers should plant resistant maize types, and fields which have been affected by the disease should be rotated withnon cereal crops like sunflower, soybean for atleast 1 year. When carrying out crop rotation farmers must rotate maize with crops which cannot be affected by turcicum leaf blight disease. Farmers should not plant maize if maize which was in the garden during the previous season was attacked by turcicum leaf blight. Leftover parts of plants which were attacked by turcicum leaf blight should be buried soon after harvest so that they can rot quickly and prevent the disease from occuring again. Farmers can also get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which fungicides to use and when to spray maize (it is usually best to spray when spots first become visible on the lower leaves) in order to effectively control turcicum leaf blight.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves having rectangularelongated brownish gray dead spots running parallel to leaf veins","id":"a0r70000000StZaAAK","content":"This disease is called gray leaf spot and is caused by some types of fungi. The disease may increase in maize if a farmer does little ploughing or digging in a maize garden. Gray leaf spot develops quickly if maize is in conditions of high humidity and when its leaves stay wet for long. Maize which has gray leaf spot may have its leaves start to look like they are very old immediately after flowering and grains found on the maize cobs will be of poor quality. Signs of the disease include leaves having small scratches or dead areas surrounded by yellow which are visible when the leaf is held up against the sun and within about 2 weeks these spots become rectangular elongated brown gray dead spots growing parallel to the leaf veins. These gray dead spots may join and make the whole affected leaf dry up and die. Prevention and control: Farmers should plant maize seeds which are resistant to diseases, avoid moisture or wetness getting onto the leaf surfaces (for example irrigation should be done late in the afternoon or early evening especially after it is seen that gray leaf spot disease has attacked the maize garden). The disease can be controlled by planting maize seeds which are resistant to the disease and keeping the maize garden clean. Farmers can also use some chemicals (fungicides) to control gray leaf spot but they MUST always get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which chemical to use when fighting gray leaf spot disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Very small scattered spots on youngest leaves white to yellowish narrow broken lines running parrallel along leaves","id":"a0r70000000StZbAAK","content":"This disease is called maize streak and it is caused by a virus which is spread by leafhoppers after they have fed on maize plants which have the disease. Leafhoppers that have fed on infected plants can carry and spread the maize streak virus for a long time. Maize streak can also be found in wild grasses and many cereal crops. Signs of maize streak disease include very small round scattered spots in the youngest leaves of maize plants which start appearing on the youngest leaves within a week after maize has been infected with the virus. The number of spots increases as the plant grows and they enlarge into narrow broken lines running parallel to the leaf veins.With time the spots become very many at leaf bases and fully grown leaves lose their green colour developing broken yellow lines along the leaf veins. Infected maize may grow slowly and if it is affected early it will not develop cobs or will die while it is still very young. Prevention and control: Farmers should plant maize seeds which are resistant to diseases (disease resistant maize seeds can be got from most farm input supplier shops). Other ways to control maize streak disease include planting maize early in the season, removing all grass weeds in or around the maize garden and controlling leafhoppers.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"What to do before harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StZcAAK","content":"To ensure a good standard of quality of maize to be harvested farmers should make sure the drying place/equipment is clean and disinfected, remove old grain and dirt from things like harvesting tools, carts, bags or baskets that will come into contact with harvested grain (if possible fumigate or treat them with boiling water to kill insects and their eggs to avoid infection of new grain).

Generally the fruits are mature and ready for harvest when theysnap off at the bending of the fruit and these can be stored/ transported to distant markets. Fresh fruits destined for the local market are plucked when almost ripe while those destined for export are harvested when beginning to turn yellow-green at the fruit base. They are cut off with a sharp knife, leaving a stem which is later trimmed to 3.4cm. Some times ripeness and quality can be judged by snapping a finger against the side of the fruit. A good, ripe fruit gives a dull, solid sound while immaturity and poor quality fruits give a hollow knock. Harvested fruits can be stored up to 4-6 weeks at 7�C. NEVER bruise fruits as this will cause rotting and lower quality.

The rate at which passion fruits grow and the amount of yield harvested depend on how fertile the soil is.

Farmers can repeatedly add fertiliser to soil after harvesting to help restore nutrients that have been lost from the soil  nutrients that have been used up by the passion fruit trees and to increase the speed at which young branches grow since these young branches later on produce fruit. Adding manure to soil in passion fruit gardens also helps to controlthe effect of viruses on the growth of passion fruits (Since plants have a high level of nutrition they wont be strongly affected by virus attacks). Passion fruit flowers may die if the soil does not have enough potassium and farmers can avoid this by adding manure to the soil. Adding manure to soil also increases soil's ability to hold moisture and promotes continuous growth in plants. Inorganic fertilizers such as NPK (17:17:17)  NPK (10:5:20  at 1.36 kg per plant 4 times a year) and Murate can also be used (get instructions from stockists on how to use these fertilisers).

Pruning also helps to expose pests to their enemies like predators  and to unfavorable conditions like strong sunshine  rain and wind  it helps to disentangle the holdings of the tendrils so that each of the branches hangs on its own for ease of management and pruning  helps toensure that important parts of the plant get enough nutrients which helps these parts to produce big high quality marketable fruits. Ensure that only one shoot is led to the support wire. When pruning  allow the terminal shoot to grow above the support wire by about 10 cm  and then cut off the bud. This will stimulate production of lateral branches and the farmer should select only two of them and try making each one to grow towards the pole. As they grow along the wire attached to the supportpoles  they will also produce other branches. These branches should be helped to hang by disentangling the holdings of the tendrils. If this is not done  the branches will tie up resulting in poor exposure of leaves to sunshine  poor exposure of flowers to pollinators  raising temperatures of the plant that may start the out break of brown spot disease and makes pruning difficult. ALWAYS disinfect tools every after pruning a plant to prevent disease spread from one plant to another. Dip tools inJIK after working on each plant  heat tools in flame or use alcohol methanol to clean them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed control","id":"a0r70000000StgWAAS","content":"Weeds are dangerous to passion fruits since they harbor pests and diseases  compete with plants for nutrients leading to low yields. Removing weeds from passion fruits helps eliminate hosts of mites and other passion fruit pests (like mites  aphids  white flies and thrips)  lowers competition for nutrients and water  eliminates risk of diverting away beneficial insects (like bees which help pollinate passion fruits). Removing weeds also eases general crop management  eliminates risk of fire in dry weeds  lowers risk of rats and rodent attacks. Farmers can control weeds in passion fruits by ring hoeing around the passion fruit plants (the circle dug around the passion fruit plant should be 1.5 m in diameter) and slashing the rest of the area or by spraying herbicides (herbicides should be sprayed away from passion fruit plants and they should be applied in a manner that wind does not blow herbicide to the passion fruits). Farmers should only apply herbicides like Propanil that will only kill weed parts in contact or Butachlor and 2 4-D that will kill whole weed plants after single point contact. Farmers should be careful when removing weeds from passion fruit gardens since injuries to the base of the vines may allow entrance of disease causing organisms. Damaging passion fruit vines during weeding can be avoided by hand weeding or the application of herbicides around the main passion fruit stems (these practices will also protect passion fruit roots which are shallow and can easily be damaged).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

The best way to do this may be by removing the mother from the pig house and leaving piglets in an area they are used to for some time. Weaning should be done slowly over a 4 day period by reducing food given to the female pig each day to just 3 kg since this will help to make it stop producing milk for the piglets. Farmers can also practice split weaning and this is done by removing all piglets that are above average size from the litter at the end of the 5th week and allowing small piglets to suckle for an extra 4 to 5 days. This gives small piglets a chance to take more milk and add on extra weight. Piglets which are above 8 weeks old should not be allowed to suckle milk from their mother (this helps them gain weight and strength to fight diseases).

Ifthere is a pig which has given birth within 3 days then farmers should adjust litter size to match the number of functioning teats or ability of the pig to produce milk. Farmers should move larger piglets to a foster female pig (this should be done before piglets are 3 days old). Farmers should make sure that piglets have received the first milk from their real mother before they are moved to another female pig. Female pigs can sometimes identify their own piglets from others using their smelland they may use this to refuse other piglets given to them which are not their own; to avoid this, farmers piglets should try hiding the smell of the piglets so that the mother cannot identify its young and this can be done by smearing all the piglets including her own piglets with a strong smelling substance like iodine or soaking all the piglets thoroughly in a salt solution.

Another way for farmers to fight weeds is to prepare seed beds early since this allows weeds to germinate with the first rains and when followed by a very shallow harrowing will greatly reduce the amount of weeds in the wheat crop.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop rotation","id":"a0r70000000SthHAAS","content":"Crop rotation is very useful in controlling weeds in wheat.

Ear rot disease attacks maize passing through holes made by pests like earworms, borers and birds when they are feeding. Maize suffering from ear rot may be harmful to feed to birds like chicken. Signs of ear rot include pink andreddish colour on maize cobs and grains, maize cobs developing irregular discoloured areas on husks. The discoloured areas enlarge until the husks become completely dried although the maize plant is still green. If husks are removed the maize ears appear chaffy and discoloured with a white cotton-like growth between maize grains. Late in the season many small black things (fungi) form on maize grains and cobs. Maize cobs which are heavily affected by ear rot are light in weight. Infection oftenoccurs through the stem and moves from cob to grains. \n\nPrevention and control: To prevent ear rot, farmers should plant maize seed types which are resistant to diseases.  Farmers can control ear rot by fighting pests that attack maize since holes made by these pests as they feed can lead to ear rot.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"White fungal growth on plants causing decaying","id":"a0r70000000StaJAAS","content":"Cabbage blight is caused by fungus.

However nitrogen fertilizer tends to reduce oil percentage of the seed  change the amino acid balance  and increase leaf area of the plant. Yield increases when up to 80kg/acre of Nitrogen fertilizer are applied. Nitrogen recommendations in dryer regions can be made from estimates of nitrate nitrogen in the soil (contact NARO for soils analysis). In the wetter regions recommendations are based upon soil organic matter and previous crop history  and it is recommended to apply 8kg Nitrogen /acre after fallow  27kg Nitrogen /acre after small grain and 36 to 45kg Nitrogen /acre after corn. On higher organic matter soils  amounts should be lowered. Nitrogen can be supplied from mineral or non-mineral sources (manures and legume stover  compost). Row placement of Phosphorus and potassium may be important in sunflower for maximizing efficiency of fertilizer use  as it is with many species. Recommendations for applications of Phosphorus and potassium should be made from soil tests and the yield goal for each field. Apply extra phosphorus and potassium when the flower bud begins to develop  to promote bigger blooms. Recommendations range from 18 to 32kg/acre P2O5 and 27 to 64kg/acre K2O for soils testing very low in Phosphorus or potassium  depending on soil yield potential. These recommendations decrease as soil test Phosphorus and/or potassium increase. Response to Phosphorus is not expected if soil Phosphorus exceeds 13kg/acre nor to potassium if the potassium tests is greater than 136kg/acre.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWbAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Intercropping","id":"a0r70000000StguAAC","content":"Sunflower can be grown as a pure stand but can also be intercroped with other anuals especially legumes (Beans  Soya beans).\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWcAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Birds","id":"a0r70000000StgvAAC","content":"One of the most serious constraints to sunflower production in Uganda is birds.

Farmers should be careful to burn cleared vegetation when conditions are favourable (do notburn on windy days and have enough people with fire fighting equipment ready so that they can put out the incase it becomes uncontrolled.)\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luweero","id":"a0r70000000Su5yAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buikwe","id":"a0r70000000Su5zAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nwoya","id":"a0r70000000Su60AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su61AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su62AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rubirizi","id":"a0r70000000Su63AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mitooma","id":"a0r70000000Su64AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buhweju","id":"a0r70000000Su65AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sheema","id":"a0r70000000Su66AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pader","id":"a0r70000000Su67AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bushenyi","id":"a0r70000000Su68AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kitgum","id":"a0r70000000Su69AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Agago","id":"a0r70000000Su6AAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mukono","id":"a0r70000000Su6BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nakaseke","id":"a0r70000000Su6CAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su6DAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4RAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Oyam","id":"a0r70000000Su6EAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su6FAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Choosing the right seeds","id":"a0r70000000StlsAAC","content":"You choose the type of seeds to plant by considering the seeds' resistance to diseases and hard weather conditions like drought and heavy rains, how long they take to mature, how much buyers like them, the climate of your area and how much yield the seeds can give.Farmers growing beans to feed the family may prefer bean types that cook faster while a farmer growing beans for sale may plant bean types that are on high demand in the market.

Signs of chalkbrood include young ones of bees (larvae) becoming chalk white and being covered with cotton like hairs. The white colour of young ones will start changing to gray or black. Infected or dead young ones of bees may be seen at the hive entrance. Prevention and control: Beekeepers should improve ventilation (flow of air) in hives to avoid moisture collecting in the hives; ventilation can be improved by making more holes on the hive. Old black brood combs (where the young ones of bees are kept) should be destroyed because they may be having organisms which cause chalkbrood disease.

The farmer should then remove seedlings from the plastic coverings and place the seedlings upright in the planting holes making sure that atleast 2 cm of the stem will be covered by soil (farmers should make sure that seedlings are planted uppright and not bent or at an angle in the soil). The farmer should replace soil in the hole around the roots making sure that the seedling and roots remain in an upright position. The soil which has been placed in the hole should then be firmed with hands (not feet) and this is done by pushing the soil down and in but not with too much force).\nAnother way of planting is called water planting and it involves adding water to the newly planted seedlings. This type of planting gives seedlings an excellent start and leads to very high survival rates but it is expensive and requires alot of work to get water to the planting site to keep up with the planting. About 2.4 litres of water maybe needed per seedling planted.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StX2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Clearing the land","id":"a0r70000000StiFAAS","content":"This is the removal of vegetation which is on the land on which eucalyptus is going to be planted.

Liquid manure is made by soaking 50kg of cattle, goat or poultry manure in 150 litres of water for 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks dilute the liquid with 300 litres of water and pour half a litre around each plant. Do not pour the manure on the plant.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYNAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site selection","id":"a0r70000000StmHAAS","content":"Cotton grows well in warm areas with enough sunshine.

Tanning skins and manufacturing leather products adds 5 to 10 times value to the skins. In hot humid conditions skin rotting occurs quickly and spoils the skin. \nThe first stage in the preservation of fresh skins is known as curing and there are 2 simple methods of skin curing. \n1.  Air-drying: - The wet skin is either  pegged out on the ground or tied to a frame and dried upright. It is important to avoid any damage to the skin and to try not to spoil the edges through clumsy pegging or tying. In climates that are not too humid  skins can be cured in 1-2 days. \n2. Salt Curing: - The fresh skin is cleaned of any blood or dirt  and washed with clean water. It is laid out with the inside facing upwards. Salt equivalent to 40 % of its weight is sprinkled on to it  until it is covered in an even layer. The salt will serve both to reduce its water content and to prevent bacterial development. The skin can be folded with the salted side inside and kept in this way for long periods before tanning. \n3. The advanced form of skin processing is leather tanning. There are different types of leather that can be produce from goatskins. Vegetable tanned leather: this has the most potential for rural area tanning.

Signs of the disease include infected cabbage heads becoming soft  watery and at times rotting completely. The affected area on cabbages become soft  mushy and generally turn dark in colour. First signs of bacterial soft rot are an initial infection on the outer leafstalks of cabbages which are in contact with the soil  and the infection spreads to the cabbage heads. Soft rot infection in cabbages almost always emits a bad smell and eventually cabbage leaves  sterns and roots are entirely decayed.

Bacterial soft rot can be controlled by planting cabbages on ridges or raised beds to prevent water logging around the plants  preventing other cabbage diseases such as black rot and damping off since they may provide opportunities for bacterial soft rot to develop. Farmers should harvest healthy cabbage heads first and store them in a cool  dry  airy place  wash hands and harvesting knives  remove and destroy diseased cabbages or left over stems in the field after harvesting. Farmers should also avoid growing crops in the cabbage family in the same field for a period of at least three seasons.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000StfuAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StfvAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StfwAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StfxAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop Management","id":"a0r70000000StfyAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StfzAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000Stg0AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000Stg1AAC","content":"No Content\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000Stg2AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000Stg3AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000Stg4AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site selection","id":"a0r70000000StgzAAC","content":"Sunflower is an annual plant  growing to a height of 2.0m (6-7ft) with a growth cycle of five months.

The demands of a sunflower crop on soil macronutrients are not as great as for maize  wheat or potato. Nitrogen is usually the first limiting factor for yield in sunflower. Medium to high levels of macronutrients are usually required for sunflower growth. Ploughing Stover back into soil will usually avail many of these macronutrients. Sunflower poorly tolerates salt  therefore avoid such areas. Sunflower is tolerant of both low and high temperatures but more tolerant to low temperatures. Sunflower seeds will germinate at temperatures of at least 8 to 10�C and  optimum temperatures for growth are 21 to 25�C  but a wider range of temperatures (18 to 32�C) show little effect on productivity. Extremely high temperatures lower oil percentage  seed fill and germination. Sunflower is not considered highly drought tolerant  but is better than Maize and a few others crops.

Dehorning can be done by smearing a chemical (caustic paste or stick) on the horn as it emerges; a clipper or a saw can also be used to dehorn cattle (if the horn is already old and hard).

Important records to keep in a dairy farm include; cow identification number, date of birth, birth weight, age when calf stopped taking milk, reproductive status (pregnant, milking, etc), date when the cow last gave birth, date of service (mating), amount of milk that the cow produces daily, date when a pregnant cow is expected to give birth, health status (if the animal is suffering from any disease and treatment given).

It should be done by an experienced person under clean conditions to avoid spreading diseases to the cow.

Calves and 1 year old heifers (young cows that have not yet produced calves) that are kept in a good shelter (with a good dry area on which the animals can lie) will grow more quickly in cold conditions compared to those that are not kept in a shelter. The calf shed should be constructed ona dry surface and if possible with a concrete floor (farmers that cannot afford a concrete floor should compress the ground and make sure it is very hard and dry). Calf shelters do not need to be expensive structures but they should be built in ways that allow for easy cleaning and maintenance of hygienic conditions. Cattle shelters should be at least twice as deep as they are wide or high to prevent too much wind from entering even if the front is left open. Cattle shelters should also be wellventilated and positioned in such a way that they get enough sunlight but keep out rain and too much wind (shelters should have at least half of their walls solid to protect the calf from excessive wind while providing enough ventilation). Calves should get enough sunlight because it helps them warm themselves, disinfects bedding and stimulates production of vitamin D which helps calves use well the milk they take. The shelter is considered adequate if it is comfortable for a person to sit dressed only in light clothing. When building cattle shelters, focus should be put on protecting calves from extreme weather and not normal weather conditions because the hair on calves' skins is enough to provide protection from normal weather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Different houses for cows of different ages","id":"a0r70000000StNUAA0","content":"It is a good practice to keep young cows in separate shelters according to their age and the condition in which they are (whether they are pregnant or sick).

For cattle kept in structures without a roof, farmers should increase space and make it double the size of that which is provided for cattle kept in a structure that has a roof. Poorly designed housing can make management of cattlehard, makes it easy for certain diseases to attack cattle and the animals may also injure themselves. The floor of the cattle house should easy to clean and should be slanting towards a manure pit so that urine and water can easily flow away; concrete floors are easy to clean and are more durable. A good structure should be built with its short sides facing the direction of the sun to ensure that they provide enough shade. A shade should be provided over the area where cows rest and feed from; drinking troughs should also be in a shade to keep drinking water as cool as possible.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Teat Length","id":"a0r70000000StNWAA0","content":"A good dairy cow should not have short teats as these make milking difficult.

From the time it is planted, it produces seed in abouttwo months. The leaves of this Dodo can be eaten as a vegetable and its seed can be used to make many products. Margret Nabatanzi from Kikandwa uses the seed of this Dodo to produce many products. She harvests the seed when the flowers (seed pulps) turn yellowish, places them on a polythene or mat and beats them to remove the seed. She dries the seed under the sun until they are dry. During a hot sunny day, the seeds will dry in one day. She then roasts the seed and after that, the seeds can beeaten or ground into flour which she uses to make soup, cakes or tea. She says eating the products from this seed helps to treat ulcers.\n\nAttribution: Provided by Margrete from Kikandwa.

Farmer can grow pumpkins with other crops like banana and coffee. Doroviko a farmer from Mubende grows pumpkins and uses them to make juice. He gets a mature pumpkin, washes it, cuts it and removes the seed. He cuts it into small pieces and pounds it. He then pours water and filters to obtain the juice. He uses different amounts of water depending on the type of pumpkin being processed. If he adds orange juice, he can store the juice for 7 days. It is important that you use a clean equipment when making this juice and wash them immediately after making the juice. The remains obtained after filtering the juice can be given to goats and pigs or dried and fed to chicken.

Some external parasites spread diseases to cattle while others only cause damage on cattle's skin. Most parasites prefer staying on specific parts of cattle like the ears  neck  elbows  udder  scrotum and around the tail. SYMPTOMS of cattle being disturbed by external parasites include cattle losing weight  skin losing its normal good shiny condition and becoming dull  having scabies and becoming rough as well as developing wounds which may in some cases become infested with maggots especially if flies are on the cattle. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should keep the house where cattle are kept and the grazing area clean by removing all dung and leftover feeds  any cracks in the house where cattle are kept should be repaired immediately they are seen and the cattle house should also be regularly sprayed with the right insecticides and acaricides that can chase away external parasites (farmers should consult veterinary doctors in their area on which pesticides when controlling external parasites). Treatment: If the number of ticks on cattle is small then they can be removed by hand; animals that have external parasites should be separated from the rest of the herd and if cattle are attacked by too many external parasites then farmers should seek help from a veterinary doctor in their area.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Calf pneumonia Calf having mucus discharge from nose high body temperature difficulty in breathing and having a dull or weak appearance","id":"a0r70000000StMvAAK","content":"This disease is called disease is called calf pnumonia and is caused by a virus; if the affected calf gets other infections the disease can become worse. It usually affects calves up to 6 month of age but old cows can be carriers of the disease. Spread of calf pneumonia is increased by mixing calves with old cows  overcrowding  poor hygiene in calf pens  and using dirty equipment. SYMPTOMS include a mucus discharge from the nose  high body temperature  difficulty breathing and dull or weak appearance. The symptoms will worsen during cold weather. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should maintain a high level of hygiene in the house where calves are being kept  calves of lessthan 6 months should not be mixed with old cows  the house where calves are kept should be well ventilated and should not be overcrowded.  Treatment: Calves suffering from calf pneumonia can be treated by injecting them with antibiotics (farmers must seek advice from veterinary doctors in their area on which antibiotics to use and how to inject the calves).

Milkers must remember to first wash and dry their hands before they start milking. At every milking, the first milk drops from each teat should be used to test for mastitis and cows found to have mastitis should be milked last. Milking should be done fast but gently and should be completed between 7 and 10 minutes. After milking, the teats should be dipped in a sanitizing solution (ask your veterinary doctor or at a farmer supply shop about the best to use) to remove any particles of milk and kill any bacteria on the teat. Thecows should be offered with feeds after milking so that they can remain standing for at least 15 minutes to allow the teat canal to close before the cows lay down (this can help prevent mastitis). Milkers should wash their hands before milking each cow to avoid transmitting diseases from one cow to another. The milk collected should be sieved using a clean white cloth and then it should be measured and recorded so that each cow's level of milk production can be followed. Dairy farmers should make sure that milk is stored away from strong smelling things (like garlic, paraffin, paint) as well as poisonous chemicals or equipment used to apply chemicals.

Any changes that are to be introduced in how milking is done should be introduced slowly with time. Before milking  the udder and teats should be cleaned with slightly warm water  an antiseptic (like potassium permanganate solution) and dried witha clean cloth. The cow being milked should be in a comfortable position because animals that are comfortable produce more milk. When milking  each cow should be milked between 5 and 7 minutes. Milking pails in which milk is put should be clean (farmers should try buying milking pails that have a dome shaped top instead of using ordinary buckets or vessels). All milk should be completely milked out of the cow because leaving some milk in the udder can encourage occurance of diseases like mastitis.

Fish farming requires some money to start and needs to be carried out on land which has a nearby source of water that flows throughout the year. The money is used to buy equipment like hoes, pick axes and spades to construct the pond, pay labour for construction of the pond, buy fingerlings (young fish) and feeds for fish. Before starting a fish farm, farmers should first find out if there is market for fish, which type of fish the available customers want and how much they can buy; all this will help farmers avoid losses due to lack of market and low market prices. Carrying out fish farming in an area where people's culture and customs do not allow them to eat fish is very likely to lead to losses for a fish farmer. The fish farmer should draw a plan of how the farm will be managed, inputs needed, costs of buying these inputs, expected number of fish per year as well as expected profits. Farmers who have never done fish farming should start with a small pond to help them get experience before they can put a lot of money in the business.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StGhAAK","content":"Fish is a source of proteins and is liked by very many people. Most people who do not eat meat due to health problems atleast eat fish and this has increased market for fish. Fish farming refers to raising and keeping of fish in ponds or tanks for commercial purposes. Fish farming requires little land since a large number of fish can be kept in a small pond compared to the land needed for keeping other animals like goats and cows. Fish farming also enables farmers to use wetlands that may not be used for growing of crops and rearing of animals. Fish can be fed on waste from the kitchen, animal feed leftovers and as well as manure which ensures that farmers can get income from these wastes. Currently, fish in Uganda is mainly obtained from lakes and rivers and the number of fish in these rivers and lakes is declining rapidly due to use of poor fishing methods (small sized nets). Reduction of fish got from lakes and rivers gives an opportunity for farmers that invest in fish farming to get a good income. Fish has ready market both in rural and urban areas and the farmer can harvest a few fish each day depending on the number of people willingto buy. This avoids wastage due to lack of market. Farmers need to get skills and advice on how best to carry out fish farming before they start investing their money in it.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Local cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Exotic cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Dairy Cow Judgement","id":"a0r70000000StGkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowish-white diarrhoea shedding of feathers high death rate","id":"a0r70000000StKpAAK","content":"This is Fowl typhoid disease.

Farmers may need to give iron supplements to newly born piglets and ways of doing this include: iron tablets which farmers can buy and crush to make a paste which should then be put in piglets mouths 24 hours after they are born. Another way of supplying iron to piglets is placing clods of red soil in the pen in which the piglets are since eating such soil gives iron to piglets (farmers should get clean soil from areas where no people or animals have stepped (like anthills) to protect piglets from worms). Farmers can also buy an iron solution and rub it on the sow teats to help piglets get some iron as they suckle. Farmers can also consult a veterinary doctor to give piglets an injection of iron (only experienced and qualified vets should administer the injection).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Caring for the navel cord area","id":"a0r70000000StKJAA0","content":"A few minutes after piglets are born their umbilical cords may be pulled gently away or cut if necessary (to a length of about 1 inch).

However, the farmer is advised to be present and carefully look at how the pig gives birth in case it experiences any problem which might require the farmer to give the pig or the piglets it is producing. Some female pigs especially the young ones can injure or kill their piglets when they are giving birth (by lying on them) so farmers should remove piglets until the process of giving birth has ended and they can be returned after the mother has settled down. Piglets may be born when they are all covered in membranes which may prevent them from breathing; if breathing does not start the farmer should clear the membranes away, massage the chest area, hold the piglets by the legs and swing them gently since this helps them to start breathing. If some piglets are too weak to suckle or fail to locate a teat the farmer should guide them to a teat. If piglets have very long navel chords farmers should shorten them by cutting off a piece, and the end attached to the piglet should be dipped in an iodine solution to prevent infection.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signsof a pig about to give birth","id":"a0r70000000StKNAA0","content":"When a pregnant pig is about to give birth she becomes restless about 24 hours before she gives birth.

This can lead to small swellings appearing under the skin on the inside part of the affected ear. When the ear is touched it is hot and the rabbit will appear tobe in pain. With time  the swellings (which can become big) will become very hard. Prevention and treatment:  It is important to clear mites from rabbits since they can move from one animal to another. Ears of all the rabbits kept should be checked regularly. Remove the crusts  scales with the help of cotton wool and then apply ear canker preparation (it is readily available in veterinary outlets) or ear drops. Until the mites are removed the rabbit will continue shaking its head. A farmer cantest if there are mites in a rabbits ear by gently inserting a cotton bud into the ear and wiping it around. If there are mites they will be stuck to the cotton bud with a brown substance. The mites look like very small fleas; they cause alot of trouble to the rabbit if they are not controlled. Farmers can also dust the rabbits with recommended chemicals or use diatomite powder if it is available. If you keep the rabbit houses clean and dry then the problem of mites is not likely to occur.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Egg production","id":"a0r70000000StLvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StLwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StLxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of chicken layers","id":"a0r70000000StLyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StLzAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing chicken houses","id":"a0r70000000StM0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJ0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to collect and store propolis","id":"a0r70000000StM1AAK","content":"When harvesting propolis a knife or hive tool should be used to collect the smears and lumps of propolis from parts of the hive but care should be taken not to remove paint from the hive and also not to damage the wood from which the hive is made.

Bees usually carry waste out of and away from the hive but if a small lizard or mouse finds its way into the hive and dies there, bees may be unable to carry it out through the hive entrance and in such a case bees cover it in propolis to prevent it from rotting and creating bad smells inside the hive. Beekeepers can make bees produce more propolis by making spaces found inside the hive bigger.

A cow on heat will also produce less milk than it usually produces. At milking time, cows should be observed for atleast 10 minutes about 3 times each day; early morning and late afternoon are the best times to look out for signs of heat in cows since at these times cows are calm (heat may occur during the night so observation in the early morning and late evening is very important). It is very important for farmers to feed their cattle well (on high quality grass) because poor feeding can cause heat to last only a few hours and it may pass by without being noticed.

Know the type and variety of seeds recommended in your area. Such varieties should have the recommendation from the Ministry of Agriculture  NARO  NAADS or extension workers.  2. Note all the quality characteristics and standards on the label and be sure theyare what you require. Read all promotional posters. Ask for advice on how and when to plant those seeds.  3. Check the seed packages carefully. All certified seed has been inspected during production by Ministry of Agriculture  and will have an identification label attached to the seed package. It has been tested to make sure it is pure and will germinate.  4. Look around the store to ensure that the seed has been kept properly and protected from rain and excessive heat. Check the package carefully for any signs of damage or insect infestation.  5. Look at the date when the seed was produced. Dont buy seed that is more than one year old or has passed the listed expiry date.  6. Always KEEP your seed package and RECEIPT so that you can complain if there is a problem.  7. Buy early so you can test the germinationn before you plant your entire field.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by UNADA\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsfAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General info","id":"a0r70000000StssAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsgAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Overview","id":"a0r70000000StstAAC","content":"All plants need food (nutrients) for them to grow properly.

Coffee berry disease does not kill coffee trees but it greatly reduces yield which farmers would have got from their coffee crops. Signs of the disease include young expanding coffee berries slowly turning black. Small water filled spots appear on the coffee berries and these spots quickly become dark, sunken and as they spread they make coffee berries rot. Coffee berries also often drop from the branch at an early stage of the disease. Lesions may also occur on young berry stalks, causing them to break off the tree before the berries are affected. The disease also affects ripening berries causing a 'brown blight' phase and this phase is characterised by dark, sunken lesions which cover the ripe red berries. The coffee berry disease may also infect flowers under very wet conditions, and causes brown lesions on petals. Farmers can control the disease by removing berries which are affected from coffee trees, pruning coffee trees after harvesting, removing old stems and thinning out branches as well as timely spraying with copper(NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-3015:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthkAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves and upper side of leaves losing green colour","id":"a0r70000000StpwAAC","content":"This disease is called coffee leaf rust and it affects leaves causing them to drop if the disease is severe.

As the spots expand they become powdery and yellow to orange and the leaves eventually drop off. This can lead to coffee berry loss and reduction in yields and quality. Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. To prevent coffee leaf rust plant improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee.�\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SteDAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making shade trees","id":"a0r70000000StpxAAC","content":"Establishing shade trees in coffee gardens provides good growing conditions for young coffee trees.

They should remove tree stumps and roots that could harbour pests, collect cleared vegataion in small rows or hills (trash bunds) which are between 0.5 m to 1 m wide since this helps prevent soil erosion and provides humus when the collected cleared vegetation eventually decomposes. Farmers should not burn the trash because burning can lead to loss of organic nitrogen plus sulpher and it also destroys important soil organisms and humus in the uppermost layers of the soil.  After land clearing, cover crops like velvet bean should be planted to help fight weeds like couch grass and spear grass and to improve soil fertility.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SteDAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tilling","id":"a0r70000000Stq0AAC","content":"This helps to break up soil,make it loose and to make it easy for young coffee roots to spread in the soil and establish faster.

Rows should be marked out in straight lines using a string and pegs since planting coffee in lines makes it easy to carry out other operations which are done when caring for coffee plants. If the coffee is to be planted on steep slopes then planting holes should be marked along contours. Space left between the planting rows should be 2.4m by 2.4m apart to ease other activities which will be done later when caring for coffee and to ensure correct plant population (about 640 coffee trees should be planted per acre). When digging holes farmers should pile top soil on the upper slope and the subsoil on the lower slope in relation to thehole. Holes made for planting should be 60cm by 60cm by 60cm (2ft by 2ft by 2ft) in size for optimum growing conditions and quick establishment of the tender young coffee roots. Apply 1 basin of well rotten manure or mature compost per hole to help the coffee plants grow faster. After placing the seedling in the hole, fill the planting hole with top soil first and complete by filling with sub soil mixed with mature manure or compost.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SteDAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making windbreaks","id":"a0r70000000Stq2AAC","content":"Windbreaks protect coffee crops from strong winds and provide regulated permanent shade.

If diseases like late blight occur, farmers may harvest irish potatoes before they are fully grown to avoid making a total loss. When harvesting, irish potato plants should be pulled out of the soil using hands if the ground is soft; if the ground is hard, hoes can be used to dig the plant out of the soil but care should be taken not to cut or damage the irish potatoes in the soil.  A good way of protecting irish potatoes from damage as they are being harvested or transported is by cutting the top parts of irish potato plants off about 10 to 14 days before harvesting is done (this helps potatoes to develop a hard skin while they are still in soil). If the harvested potatoes are to be used for planting, farmers should store them in heaps or piles for about 1 to 2 weeks so that their skins can become hard (during this time farmers should identify and remove any rotten or cut potatoes).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StY7AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StY8AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StY9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYAAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Types","id":"a0r70000000StYBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StYCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparation and Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthlAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How and when to plant","id":"a0r70000000Stq4AAC","content":"Farmers should plant and maintain a plant population of 640 coffee trees per acre.

This should be done in areas with soft deep soils and it reduces the number of weeds that grow up in the cotton.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSNAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Where to get seed","id":"a0r70000000StYOAA0","content":"Farmers should obtain cotton seed from Cotton marketing boards or from other companies that will buy cotton in the area or from trusted seed suppliers.

A planned and coordinated method of putting out a fire is far more effective than having each person trying to put out the fire in their own way (this may also put people's lives in danger). Important things to look out for when fighting a fire are what thefire is doing, how fast it is moving, how strongly it is burning, what it is burning and where it is going. The best way to put out a fire is to fight ahead of it (clearing or burning vegetation ahead of it so that by the time it reaches there it has nothing to burn and dies out). When the front of the fire is cut off, people fighting the fire can start trying to put it out from the back and sides by removing all vegetation which it may burn and this will help to slowly start making the fire smaller and easier to put out. When fighting a fire it is important to make sure that everyone has somewhere to escape to and when the fire gets too strong they can fall back to a safer area and continue fighting the fire. If whatever is being done is not affecting the fire then the people trying to put out the fire need to first stop and rethink about their plan.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StihAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Protecting beans from getting wet in the store","id":"a0r70000000StqRAAS","content":"To protect stored beans from getting wet, farmers should keep bags in which beans are being stored off the ground (this can be done by placing bags on a platform of sticks) and the sacks should also be placed atleast 1 metre away from the walls of the storage area.\nFarmers should never store newly harvested bean seeds with old beans because if the old beans are infected with insects they will spread to the new beans as well.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StihAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing a bean store and its surroundings","id":"a0r70000000StqSAAS","content":"The place in which farmers store the sacks or bags of beans should be clean, dry, well ventilated and it should not have any leaks (when it rains water should not run downthe walls of the storage place).

The length of the beds depends on the field shape and farmer?s choices. Soil in the seed bed should be dug until it is smooth and fine. The beds are separated by a pathway of 0.5m to enable the farmer to carryout operations like weeding. A shed should be put over the young plants to protect them from heavy rains and too much sunlight. This shed can be built using spear grass or banana leaves. Before sowing or planting, seeds should be treated with fungicide like Metalaxyl or Victory. This helps to prevent ants from carrying away the seeds and helps control damping off disease. Dig lines or channels at a spacing of 0.5m - 0.75m apart and 2-3 inches deep across the beds to plant the seeds. Cover the seeds lightly and water them. Mulch with rice hulls or straw or grass and water regularly. Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 4-5 weeks, when they are about 4-6 inches high. The seedlings in the nursery should be made ready for planting in the field by reducing water and exposing them to sun one week before planting.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Land preparation","id":"a0r70000000StYZAA0","content":"Fields should be dug before, or at the same time the seeds are sown.Allow enough time between digging and transfering the plants from the nursery to the main garden, so as to expose the soil to sunlight and to birds, wasps and what are known as friendly insects, which will feed on pests and help to remove weed seeds. After digging the field, then the beds should be shaped. Where soils have a heavy clay content, or are poorly drained, make mounds or raised beds. The beds should be at least 100 cm (40 inches) wide and 30 - 40 cm (12 - 15 inches) high.

Signs of leafhoppers in a maize garden include a sticky black covering on maize leaves, leaves may stop growing and dry up while still young, parts of  maize leaves may turn from green to yellow or white and maize may produce cobs with no grain. To control leafhoppers, a farmer should leave clear spaces of soil measuring 10 or 20 m between the rows of  maize and plant crops that are resistant to leafhoppers in these spaces. A farmer can also fight leafhoppers by planting maize seeds that are resistant to leafhoppers and other pests. Keeping maize gardens free of weeds and planting maize at once can also help in control of leafhoppers.

To control cutworms in maize farmers should clear all weeds from the garden atleast 2 weeks before planting. The farmer should also apply pyrethroid sprays in bands over the rows of maize. Another form of control is making barriers to protectthe planted seedlings from cutworms. Barriers can be made by wrapping paper, aluminium foil, thin cardboard or similar materials around the base of plant stems. Toilet rolls are also good to use as barriers since they are readily available and have no harm on the soil.

There are many types of termites which attack maize and damage is often very visible during very dry seasons or in areas with irregular rainfall. Termites destroy maize roots and stem bases making maize crops wilt, dry up and fall. Damage continues even after maize has fallen. If termites are many they can destroy all the maize in the field especially if they attack when maize is still young. Old maize attacked by termites will produce very poor grain quality. To control termites, maize farmers should use chemicals like terminator pyrinex, troban, endo sulphan, malataf and dusban. When using Dusban(chloryrifos) a farmer should apply 20 to 40 ml of the chemical mixed in 10 to 20 litres of water per termite mound or anthill. Where there are no termite mounds in the garden, 50 gm of Regent 3-g (fipronil) should be mixed with 2 litres of water and applied to all the locations in the field where termites are feeding. The farmer can also use insecticides that are absorbed by maize (like imidacloprid) to fight termite attacks. Other ways to control termites include ploughing field to destroy the termite nests, runways, andtunnels so that the termites are exposed to predators like ants, birds, chicken which feed on them. Practicing crop rotation can also help in reducing termites. Farmers should remove plant residues and other debris especially moist and decaying woods. Maize should also be harvested at the right time, as termites often attack maize left in the field after maturity.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Holes on maize grain and alot of grain dust in stored maize","id":"a0r70000000StnUAAS","content":"This damage is caused by large grain borers. They can make holes and live in wood and maize. They are cylindrical dark brown and are 3 to 5 mm in length. Their wing covers are flattened at the tip and look like they are cut off. Large grain borers grow from young to adult in about 27 days under favourable conditions. They can attack maize both in field and storage. Signs of large grain borers include holes on maize grains and grain dust in stored maize. Damage is caused by both adults and young large grain borers. Maize grain attacked by large grain borers loses weight, reduces in quality due to presence of droppings, cocoons and insect parts in the maize grain. Maize seeds attacked by large grain borers may also not germinate when planted. To control large grain borers, farmers should harvest maize quickly when it is ready for harvest, store maize in a clean store and in clean containers or sacks and if possible sell the maize stock in the first 3 months after harvest since the extent of large brain borer infestation during the first 3 months of storage is generally low. Mixing diatomite powder with grain before storing in bags or dusting newly harvested dry cobs before storing them with diatomite also helps fight large grain borers (use 1 kg of Diatomite per bag of maize or grain).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Large holes on maize grain and maize warm at the surface","id":"a0r70000000StnVAAS","content":"This is caused by maize weevils.

Crops with Aphid have folded leaves and the leaves may have black substances on the upper surface of the leaves. The aphids will be seen on the lower surfaces of leaves or on the folded leaves. To control these pests, Mix 25gm of dry Red pepper and 20gm of marigold and sprinkle this mixture on the plants. Make sure the powder touches the pests.  Care should be taken when applying this mixture so that it does not enter the eyes since the red pepper can damage the eyes.\n\nAttribution: Information documented by MbaZARDI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:11:01\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StVfAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StVgAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StVhAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000StViAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StVjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StVkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StVlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StVmAAK","content":"The fruit is harvested when the \"eyes\" at the base of the fruit begins changing colour and the fruit gives off the characteristic sweet aroma.

If the soil has dried  it will be necessary to use either a spade or similar tool to loosen the soil and harvest the roots. Carrots are usually ready for harvesting 60-85 days after sowing. Mature roots should be orange-colored internally down to the blunt tip. A good market price can be fetched from young carrots with a fresh top  but leaving the top on dries out the root quickly and reduces the marketing period of the crop. An alternative is to cut the top back to about 2 cm and package attractively. For mature carrots the tops are cut down completely to avoid storage rots before marketing. Carrots should be stored separately from other vegetables to prevent a bitter flavor induced by ethylene (a colorless gas with a sweet odorthat is produced by many fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening process). Generally carrots store better when they are mature and harvested under moist conditions  and undamaged and free of diseases and pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Biovision and NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StWEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StWFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StWGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWHAA0","content":"Cabbage is often hand-harvested when heads arefirm to the touch but before cracking begins.

At times green pods are picked over a long period in home gardens or hedge crops. When growing pigeon peas farmers usually practice ratoon cropping (harvesting pods in one season and leaving pigeon pea plants to produce new pods in the next season). After harvest the stems are cut back to enable the plants to grow again and a second crop is harvested in the following season. After harvesting, farmers can spread out whole pigeon pea plants or pods to dry in the air after whichthey are threshed (using hands or cattle) and the seeds are cleaned. Clean pigeon peas prevent insect attack which can lead to alot of damage in the harvested crop. Farmers can also store pigeon peas as split peas (removed from pods) to reduce attacks from small beetles which are called bruchids.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWWAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWXAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWYAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWZAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Commercial varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWaAAK","content":"There are; Sunfola (black seeded  thin seed coat  medium stature  early maturing  40% oil content and up to 1800kg/ha yield)   S400  S430  and SH 3422 whose average seed yields are 1300- 2000 kg/ha and with an oil content of 50%.

A number of wild plants, including some common weeds such as the black jack are also host of this virus. Thrips are vectors of this virus. When host plants of the virus are grown near to pineapple plants, the incidence of the yellow spot virus is considerable enhanced due to thrips migrating into the pineapple field. One of the symptoms in the fruit is a blackened, dry cavity in the side of the fruit due to one or more \"eyes\" having died. This is known as \"dead eye\". Infection of very young fruit results in an irregular arrangement of fruitlets as some fail to develop. Attacked fruits may also fail to develop a crown. These spots enlarge and the infection spreads into the fruit itself, by which time the crown will often have dried out. The flesh of fruits thus infected will be discoloured and necrotic below the butt of the crown. The whole fruit may eventually become affected. To prevent Control weeds in and around pineapple fields. This is very important for disease control because the presence of certain weeds leads to increased number of thrips. Field management offers potential effective control. Cut off the fruits showing early symptoms of infection. This will prevent the spread of infections into the fruits.

Use certified seeds and should be dressed with a broad spectrum fungicide such as captan or thiran for protection against soil borne pathogens.  After planting  cover them with a screen  as the birds and animals love to dig the seeds out. You can also start them in a seedbed (free of weeds) and with fine non compacted soil with organic matter. Transfer seedlings when they are small. Clear the main garden free of trees  shrubs and weeds. No shading is required. Till the land thoroughly  to a fine non compacted soil. A second ploughing is necessary if planting is on virgin land. Otherwise a single ploughing is sufficient on already cultivatable land. The crop is line planted (as opposed to broadcast) at a spacing of 2.5 X 1.7ft and 2 seeds per hole. An application of P205 fertilizer before planting and 60kg/ha of Nitrogen at thinning are recommended. Thinning can be done to leave only one or two plants to a hill resulting in an approximate plant population of 55 000 plants/ha. Lower plant populations are recommended in areas where rainfall is limited (on average 33 000-45 000 plants per acre in semi-arid areas). This compares with a recommendation for 45 000-60 000 plants/ha in areas where there is more moisture. Sunflower always point their blooms to the rising sun in the East.

At this stage  ready plants for harvesting will have the back of the head turned from green to yellow and the bracts have changed to brown. To harvest  cut the stems using a Panga at about 3ft above ground and the heads spiked face down on them and left to dry. Do not delay to harvest as seeds become too dry and shell out leading to field losses. It is better to harvest at 14-15% moisture.

When drying  turn every 30-60 minutes to allow equal exposure to the sun. proceed to milling when sufficiently dry and remove big stones before milling.store in a dry place in clean bags or containers for later use.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StWqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWrAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWsAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StWtAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StWuAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StWwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tree management","id":"a0r70000000StWyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Ssl7AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kemikyera market","id":"a0r70000000SsreAAC","content":"Samuel Byaruhanga. 0700466553.

Branches and top parts of the coffee tree which has been attacked break off easily but the main tree usually survives. Leaves on affected coffee trees may also start becoming yellow, drying up and may eventually die. Another sign is bits of eaten wood being pushed out of the tunnels which stem borers make in the coffee stems. Farmers should inspect their robusta coffee gardens regularly to identify infected trees. Ways of controlling stem borers include mantaining a good shade for coffee trees, cutting and burning coffee trees which are heavily infected and have coffee borers inside them. Another way of controlling stem borers is to kill them by inserting a strong wire into the holes made by borers. Farmers can also soak cotton wool in neem oil solution and insert it into bored holes to kill stem borers.

Mealy bugs may also attack coffee which has been sprayed with insecticide sprays. Farmers can control mealy bugs by spraying coffee trees with neem extract (this is made by collecting one kg of  neem leaves, pound the leaves, add 10 litres of water and stir thoroughly every 10 minutes for 1 hour. Farmers should then sieve or strain out the liquid add a matchbox size of soap to the liquid and spray affected coffee).

Farmers should not make the mixture too concentrated) or Bio Power (mix 5g of Bio Power per litre of water). Other ways to control coffee berry borers is by pruning fields regularly to reduce shade, picking ripe berries regularly (atleast once every 14 days) and spreading tarpaulin or sacks below coffee trees when harvesting to prevent infected berries from falling into the mulch (since this may spread the pests). Farmers should also not allow coffee berries and bags from infested farms to be transported to other farms since this may spread the pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small slightly raised spots on both green and ripening","id":"a0r70000000StoKAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves upper side of leaves losing green colour and leaves falling off trees","id":"a0r70000000StoLAAS","content":"This is coffee leaf rust disease and it is favoured by wet, warm weather. Signs of the disease include pale yellow spots on the lower side of coffee leaves and the spots become powdery turning from yellow to orange as the leaf matures. The coffee tree may also start producing very small coffee berries whichturn black before they are ripe. Coffee leaf rust disease also causes leaves to drop and if this happens alot the entire coffee tree can die as well as lose coffee berries. Another sign of coffee leaf rust disease is very small coffee berries which turn black before they are fully ripe. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee. Farmers can control coffee leaf rust disease by planting resistant types of robusta coffee, ensuring that coffee trees get the nutrients they require and maintainingaverage shade in the coffee garden.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Coffee trees produce less coffee leaves turn yellow drying up and death of leaves and whole tree rottin into a wet white mass with black lines","id":"a0r70000000StoMAAS","content":"This disease is called root or collar rot and it is transmitted when roots of healthy coffee come into contact with tree roots which have the disease. In coffee, collar rot disease is usually spread from old shade trees or old tree stumps left in the garden when land is being cleared. Signs of collar rot disease include a reduction in coffee being produced by the affected tree, leaves turning yellow, drying up and death of leaves and the whole tree. Roots of affected robusta coffee trees will have a white coating and when the disease is advanced the wood on coffee trees will rot into a white wet mass with black lines running through the tissue. Vertical cracks may also occur at the base of the coffee tree stem. Farmers can control collar rot by ring barking trees before they are cut down (this prevents the fungus which causes collar rot from getting nutrients which enable it to survive in old tree stumps). Farmers should also delay planting (for atleast 2 years) in a garden which had trees affected by collar rot.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowing drying and death of plants affected coffee remains firmly in soil and black or brown lines on stem when bark is removed","id":"a0r70000000StoNAAS","content":"This is called coffee wilt disease and it is caused by a fungus which blocks movement of water and nutrients from coffee roots to the rest of the plant.

Robusta coffee trees attacked by coffee wilt will remain firmly rooted in the ground. Farmers can control coffee wilt by regularly inspecting their coffee gardens to identify affected trees which should be destroyed by chopping, uprooting and burning the entire plant. Farmers should also restrict movement of infected plant materials and should not replant infected fields with coffee plants for atleast 2 years.

The stem is cut-off with a clean cut at ground level after harvesting the bunch (the stem and other parts of the banana plant that are cut off can be cut into small pieces and used during mulching). It is very important that bunches do not fall or bump during transport, as this causes them to blacken and rot.

Farmers should leave a space of 3 metres between planting holes and they should separate  top soil from sub soil (place each type of soil in a separate pile) when digging the holes. When planting, top soil should be placed into the hole first and the hole should be covered with sub soil mixed with manure or compost. The reason for separating soil is because top soil is usually rich in humus which provides ready nutrients to plants and should form the largest part of soil in which the coffee seedling is planted. The size of planting holes should be 60cm by 60cm by 60cm for the best growing conditions and to ease quick development of the young coffee roots. Farmers should apply 1 basin of well rotten manure or mature compost per hole to help robusta seedlings to develop faster.

The disease is favoured by wet warm conditions.The first symptom is formation of pale yellow spots up to 3mm in diameter on the bottom side of leaves while the upper side of leaves loses its green colour in patches. As the spots expand  they become powdery and yellow to orange and the leaves eventually drop off. This can lead to coffee berry loss and loss of yields and quality.Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rust by planting improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Carrying out regular pruning and weeding of coffee also helps in fighting the disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Caf� Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfxAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Water filled spots on leaves and rolling inwards of dried leaves dry dead leaves not falling off coffee tree","id":"a0r70000000StolAAC","content":"This disease is called bacterial blight.

Lack of enough nutrients like calcium can damage coffee roots and make the coffee receive little water which can cause dieback. Other soil nutrients like nitrogen and potassium are also important and coffee crops which do not receive them in adequate amounts can be attacked by dieback disease. Signs of dieback include young stems becoming brown or black and dying, leaves may also turn black and die but they do not fall off the tree. Dieback caused by lack of nutrients lowers yield and when the disease is strong coffee plants will die. Prevention and control: Farmers should make sure their coffee crops are getting enough shade and they should manage their coffee trees well by controlling weeds, mulching coffee fields, watering the trees, controlling pests and diseases immediately they are seen, making sure that fertilizers are used in a balanced way and that the coffee crops get enough nitrogen and potassium.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Caf� Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsV3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nyakatonzi Cooperative Union Ltd","id":"a0r70000000SsVzAAK","content":"Plot 9-3 Kasese/ Fort Portal Road,Tel:077426883, Email: ngcu@utlonline.co.ug\nThe storage charges are: \n - handling: 6/= per kg at arrival\n - drying and cleaning: 13/= per kg at arrival of 0.5% above target with increments of 3/= for each additional 0.5% moisture content\n - cleaning only: 8/= per kg\n - drying only: 5/= per kg at arrival of 0.5% above target with increments of 3/= for each additional 0.5% moisture content\n - bagging: 17/= per kg of dry clean grain\n - storage of commingled maize and paddy rice: 7.5/= per kg per month, or pro-rata for number of days stored\n - storage of commingled beans: 9/= per kg per month, or pro-rata for number of days stored\n - storage of identity preserved grain: price to be negotiated with customer\n - handling out: 3/= per kg\n - additional fumigation: 3.5/= per kg\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 14:44:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsV8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Depositing","id":"a0r70000000SsW0AAK","content":"To deposit, one must be registered on the Electronic Warehouse Receipt System (eWRS).

To control mealybugs in coffee roots  farmers should apply 10g of Furadan  Dasban or Marshal Granules per tree and mix with soil under wet conditions.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Stg0AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Transparent spots on leaves and young leaves dropping off","id":"a0r70000000Stp0AAC","content":"This is caused by leaf miners which are often present in coffee which has grown in an area with alot of shade.

These pests can kill young trees of up to 2 yrs old. Signs that coffee is infected include swellings on the coffee stems which when cut show tunnels (removing the bark off a tree or cutting stem in two across its length will show tunnels created by white stem borers)  dead trees or branches and yellow coffee leaves which are wilting or drying. Affected branches can easily break off the coffee tree. To control white stem borers apply pesticides like Fenitrothion Cypermethrin in circles on coffee stems or spray the stem about 18 inches from soil level. Coffee crops which have borers in them should be uprooted and burnt. Also cover the stem to stop the insect from laying eggs on coffee plants.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Caf� Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsV8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Overview","id":"a0r70000000SsW2AAK","content":"The WRS model being promoted by the UCE is one where: The depositors take their commodities say maize or beans which meet defined East African quality standards to UCE licensed warehouses. The Warehouse Operators grade and issue a transferable electronic warehouse receipts (eWRS) stating the commodity, the quantity and quality of commodity deposited. The Warehouse Keeper guarantees delivery of the commodity described on the Warehouse Receipt and is liable for any losses incurred. The Warehouse Receipt issued may be transferred to a new holder ? a lender (where the stored commodity is pledged as security for a loan) or to a trade counter-party (by which the buyer is entitled to take delivery of the commodity upon presentation of the Warehouse Receipt at the warehouse). Hence, if the depositor requires short-term financing, he/she can obtain an advance representing a percentage of the prevailing market value of the commodity from a bank, using the warehoused crop as collateral. The depositor can wait until such time when market conditions are conducive to sell the warehoused commodity. A depositor has to pay storage, and where applicable management fees. A depositor is also responsible for the cost of transporting the commodity to a designated warehouse.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by World Food Programme\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 14:44:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsVDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tendering","id":"a0r70000000SsW3AAK","content":"WFP regularly invites representatives from FOs to collect a bid form from the WFP country office - Kampala, or WFP regional offices.\nFOs must return the completed form by the stipulated deadline, including:\n\n - a price quote for selling their produce\n - the duration of supply\n - the exact location of the produce\n - an indication of whether the FO would like WFP tocollect the produce, or whether the FO would prefer to deliver the produce at the WFP warehouse.\n\nFOs must provide the price for the produce to be supplied.

Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Prevention and control: Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rust by planting improved coffee seed types which are resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee begins flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).

In order to provide the required cold conditions and water vapour, farmers should place buckets or pots of water in the house where mushrooms are being grown; the mushrooms should also be watered atleast twice a day (in the morning and evening) but farmers that can afford to water more than 2 times should do it. It is best to grow mushrooms in a house that has a grass thatched roof because such houses are cool inside; mushrooms can also be grown in houses that have ironsheet roofs but farmers using such houses should layout some thatch on the ironsheet roof or make a ceiling in the house to help make it cool inside. The house in which mushrooms are grown should have windows to let in light since it is needed by the mushrooms as they grow; the light inside the house should be enough for someone standing in the centre of the room to read a book.

Other vanilla pests include: Chicken which damage vanilla roots by scratching away the mulched part, exposing the roots and making the plant dry up. Termites are also a major vanilla pest especially in the dry season (termites can kill or stop the support tree from growing normally). There are also black ants that can damage flower buds that have not yet opened which makes flowers drop off before they are pollinated; these black ants also encourage mealy bugs and scale insects to attack vanilla and make flowers drop off before pollination occurs. Thieves can sometimes also steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure that chicken are kept out of vanilla gardens. Black ants can be controlled by applying ash on the soil around the support tree and vanilla vines. Vanilla gardens should be near farmers' homes because this makes it easier to inspect the vanilla everyday and may keep away thieves that steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. Vanilla stores should also be properly contructedto keep out thieves and other pests (any cracks or holes that develop should be closed or repaired quickly).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Disease","id":"a0r70000000StXcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXeAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXfAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXgAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXhAAK","content":"Ginger is ready for harvest in about 9 to 10 months after it is planted. Signs that ginger is mature enough for harvest include yellowing of leaves and stems ofginger plants breaking. Farmers can choose to leave ginger in the soil (for up to 2 years) if there is no market for them; when the rains come this ginger will germinate again and continue growing for another season. In Uganda ginger is harvested using hands (in a way that is similar to how sweet potatoes are harvested ); mature ginger is dug up from the soil using a hoe and then farmers use hands to break it off the main stem. Roots should be removed from harvested ginger, soil should be cleaned off and the ginger should then be washed in water and laid out in a shade to dry (clean ginger will be bought at better prices at the market). Under good growing conditions and when proper spacing is used at planting, farmers may harvest about 10 sacks of hybrid ginger or 5 sacks of local ginger from 1 acre of land.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MUK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000StXkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXmAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXnAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StXoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"}], "DeletedMenuItems":[], "Images":[{"id":"a0r70000000StinAAC-00P7000000BzZcpEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StipAAC-00P7000000BzZbwEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StikAAC-00P7000000BzZc1EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StioAAC-00P7000000BzZbNEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StimAAC-00P7000000BzZbrEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StilAAC-00P7000000BzZbhEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StiiAAC-00P7000000BzZckEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StqWAAS-00P7000000BzZcaEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000SteyAAC-00P7000000BzZNtEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf2AAC-00P7000000BzZd4EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf0AAC-00P7000000BzZcVEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf1AAC-00P7000000BzZc6EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StezAAC-00P7000000BzZcQEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf5AAC-00P7000000BzZbXEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf4AAC-00P7000000BzZbIEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf3AAC-00P7000000BzZbcEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StonAAC-00P7000000BzZLOEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StomAAC-00P7000000BzZYeEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StomAAC-00P7000000BzZb3EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StolAAC-00P7000000BzZYAEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StokAAC-00P7000000BzZcGEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StooAAC-00P7000000BzZb8EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StpmAAC-00P7000000BzZbmEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StplAAC-00P7000000BzZbDEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StpkAAC-00P7000000BzZcLEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StpiAAC-00P7000000BzYkREAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZZAA0-00P7000000BzYjtEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZaAAK-00P7000000BzZZ3EAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZYAA0-00P7000000BzZ2UEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StaIAAS-00P7000000BzZZZEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZbAAK-00P7000000BzZUcEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjMAAS-00P7000000BzZYUEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZoAAK-00P7000000BzZayEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZqAAK-00P7000000BzZatEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StntAAC-00P7000000BzZZYEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjEAAS-00P7000000BzZcBEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjGAAS-00P7000000BzZcuEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjHAAS-00P7000000BzZczEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjAAAS-00P7000000BzZcfEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjBAAS-00P7000000BzZdOEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjIAAS-00P7000000BzZaLEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjFAAS-00P7000000BzZdTEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjDAAS-00P7000000BzZdYEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjCAAS-00P7000000BzZb9EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stj9AAC-00P7000000BzZauEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stj8AAC-00P7000000BzZdAEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stj7AAC-00P7000000BzZdEEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFOAA0-00P7000000BzZYsEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFPAA0-00P7000000BzZYnEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFQAA0-00P7000000BzZYdEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFRAA0-00P7000000BzZZ2EAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFSAA0-00P7000000BzZZ7EAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFTAA0-00P7000000BzZZCEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFUAA0-00P7000000BzZYiEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFVAA0-00P7000000BzZYxEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFYAA0-00P7000000BzZWBEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFWAA0-00P7000000BzZVGEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFXAA0-00P7000000BzZUrEAN"}], "DeletedImages":[]}
