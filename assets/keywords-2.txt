Death of the stem vascular bundles occurs with brown to purple discoloration; this may be accompanied by cracking of the stem. The vines may turn tan to light brown. Diseased plants may manage to produce storage roots, but these usually have some discoloured, infected vascular tissues. Rot may follow in storage or the disease may be transmitted to the next crop by infected cuttings. Dying vines often have pinkish fungal growth.  Control: Use resistant varieties,  Use disease-free planting stocks, Avoid fields with a history of wilt. To reduce infection near planting time is to hold plants for 24 hours at 29°C to promote suberisation of the injured surface; also yield loss can be reduced by planting more than one transplant per hill. Even though the percent of plants affected is not reduced, yield per unit land is maintained because there is less chance that all plants in a hill will be killed and also because productivity is similar for single-plant and multiple-plant hill.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NRI, CIP, NARO, FAO, CPP, DFID\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StU5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Inner edible part of the roots black and brittle","id":"a0r70000000StanAAC","content":"These are symptoms of Diplodia black storage rot.

They cause hairiness on sweet potatoes, known as \"erinose\". Eriophyid mites are tiny, much smaller than the spider mites (about 0.2 mm long) and look like a speck of dust. They are not visible with the naked eye. The mites feed in the buds and on young foliage of sweet potato plants, injecting growth substances into it, which induce the plant to produce a dense mat of hairs. As a result the stems, leaf petioles, buds and undersides of leaves become covered with a dense layer of white hairs. The leaves and plants are also generally slightly stunted; the leaves and stems thickened, and the plants yield poorly.  Whole crops may be affected but often the symptoms affect just one or a patch of plants, and often only particular varieties. The mites invade crops by being blown like dust particles in the wind.

PREVENTION and CONTROL: Cattle should regularly be dewormed; adult cattle should be dewormed atleast once in every 6 months while calves should be dewormed once in every 3 months (WARNING: Selecting which drugs to use when deworming should be done with the help of veterinary doctors. Regular use of the same type of drug when deworming may result in parasites becoming resistant to that drug which makes it no longer effective). Pesticides can be sprayed on grass to control mites but expert advice MUST be got before this is done. Treatment: When symptoms mentioned above are seen farmers should consult veterinary doctors and also tell them when the affected cattle was last dewormed and which drug was used when deworming.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowish swelling on young pods and dark brown spots grow rapidly covering old pods","id":"a0r70000000StmwAAC","content":"Frosty pod rot disease affects pods and is spread from one pod to another by wind  insect and any other material that may touch a pod after touching one with a disease.

Chicken which show signs of the disease should be separated from the rest of the healthy birds being kept and the farmer must make sure that chicken food, water and house are always clean.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Institute of Development Strategies\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Liver flukes Swollen jaw loss in weight loss of appetite difficulty in passing out dung eyes becoming yellow","id":"a0r70000000StPbAAK","content":"This is caused by liver flukes and these are internal parasites that usually affect cattle and other livestock that grazes near ponds  swamps  lakes and other water sources. Cattle become affected by liver flukes when they eat plants contaminated with eggs of liver flukes (these eggs cannot be seen with the naked eye) and the eggs develop into adult flukes inside the liver and bile duct of cattle. SYMPTOMS include a swollen jaw (that sometimes looks can look like a bottle)  some diarrhea in the early stages and later on difficulty in passing out dung  cattle looking weak and dull  having rough raised hair  loss of appetite and reduction in the amount of milk being produced. Eyes of affected cattle may also become yellow and cattle attacked by very many liver flukes may even die. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Adult cattle should be dewormed atleast 1 time in every 6 months and calves should be dewormed between 3 and 4 times in a year(WARNING: Regular use of the same type of drug when deworming may result in parasites becoming resistant to that drug which makes it no longer effective. Selecting drugs to use when deworming should be done with the help of veterinary doctors in your area). Farmers should avoid making their cattle graze near ponds  streams  lakes or any other water body. Treatment: When symptoms are seen farmers should consult veterinary doctors and also tell them when the affected cattle were last dewormed and which drug was used when deworming. Cattle can be cured of liver flukes if they are treated but it may be difficult when eyes of affected cows start turning yellow.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StN9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Handling milk after milking","id":"a0r70000000StPcAAK","content":"After milking, the milk should immediately be filtered using a clean white filter cloth or strainer.

Use of foot baths also helps to control foot rot by killing the bacteria that cattle may have on their feet. Foot baths should be at least 2 metres in length and 0.15 metres deep.  The width  of the foot path should be the same as that of the passage where they are placed to prevent cows from bypassing the bath without using it.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNSAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Calving area","id":"a0r70000000StQ4AAK","content":"Housing structures built for cattle should also have an area where pregnant cows can calve (give birth) from; this is called a calving stall and  it makes it possible for farmers to provide special attention to cows at the important time of giving birth.  With loose housing, cows may need to be tied up in stalls and should give birth far away from the milking area and close to the area where calves are kept. The area in which cows give birth should be easy to clean and disinfect thoroughly. There should be one calving stall for every 30 stalls with a minimum of 2;\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

SIGNS: Affected chicken will have difficulty in moving around and breathing; they may also die later on. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Chicken houses should be well ventilated to avoid dust and ammonia gas from becoming too much in the house.

Coccidiosis can kill a large number of chicken before it is identified (this means the disease can attack and kill birds before showing any major signs). Coccidiosis is common in chicken that are being kept under a deep litter system and when the disease breaks out it usually spreads quickly (because birds are always in contact with litter which may have droppings that have the disease) so farmers must do all they can to prevent the disease from breaking out. SIGNS: Affected chicken lose appetite and look dull and weak; sometimes the chicken may also pass out blood stained droppings. The disease also causes a high number of deaths in young chicken and when dead birds are cut open their intestines will be swollen. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure chicks, feed and water are kept away from chicken droppings; chicken should not be overcrowded in the house in which they are being kept. Litter used in the chicken house should be kept dry, turned regularly and any wet areas in it should be removed and replaced with dry litter. If coccidiosis breaks out farmers must immediately remove birds that show signs of the disease and should start treating them immediately. There are drugs (called anticoccidials or coccidiostats) that farmers can mix in chicken feeds to help reduce levels of infection when coccidiocis breaks out (chicken that are to be slaughtered should not be given these drugs atleast 4 days before they are killed to  avoid drugs staying inside the carcass). Chicken with coccidiocis can also be treated by giving them drinking water in which Amprollium has been mixed (farmers MUST always seek advice from veterinary personnel on which drugs to use, amounts to use and how to mix the drugs).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StP1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Vaccination","id":"a0r70000000StP2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Keeping records of chicken","id":"a0r70000000StP3AAK","content":"It is very important for farmers to keep information on the broiler chicken they are keeping; this is called record keeping.

Litter should be kept dry at all times so great care should be taken not to spill any water on the litter because this will make it damp and mouldy; chicks are very likely to suffer from brooder pneumonia and other breathing (respiratory) diseases if they are kept in a house which has damp and mouldy litter. Farmers should turn the litter regularly (using a hoe, shovel or garden rake) so that it remains dry and does not become hard (it should be easy to break up into small bits when it is held in the hands). If litter in a chicken house is not looked after well it will develop a hard surface layer which can give broilers problems like breast blisters (when the birds rest down on hard litter the area around their breasts is bruised and develops wounds which later become hard; this lowers the quality of meat got from the broilers. Farmers should also be careful not to keep too many birds in a house and should make sure that there is good flow of air (proper ventilation) in the house.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Type of litter to use","id":"a0r70000000StPAAA0","content":"The litter material must be absorbent (able to take in water well from things like chicken droppings or water that pours on to the floor from drinking ).

Litter on the chicken house floor helps protect chicken from the hard floor and also makes cleaning easy (dung from the birds is easily removed when it is mixed in the litter). Keeping broilers under deep litter system enable the farmer to control conditions in the house, protects chicken from wild animals and prevents them from mixing with other local birds which protects them from diseases. The deep litter system also makes it possible to keep many chicken in little space and one person can look after a large number of birds; this reduces costs of house construction and payment for labour.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMLAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing a chicken house","id":"a0r70000000StPCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMLAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Allowing light into a chicken house","id":"a0r70000000StPDAA0","content":"Sides of a chicken house (where adult broilers are being kept) should have open sides so that enough light can enter the house during the day.

A reasonable recommendation is to supply 4,048-8,097kg/acre of organic matter. General nutrient requirements are 24-40 kgs Nitrogen, 4 kgs phosphorous, 40 kg potash.This should be applied in bits during the growing season.

Apples keep for longest in cool conditions (3C / 36F), which are well-ventilated, dark and slightly humid.  Not many of us can provide these ideal conditions, so a compromise is necessary. A good option is to store the apples in a shed or open room, with the apples in plastic bags to retain moisture - leave a 2.5cm (1in) hole in each bag to allow some air movement.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO,NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Holes in leaves","id":"a0r70000000StmeAAC","content":"This is Winter moth.Signs include holes in leaves which will spread disease to tree and weaken it.

can also be fed using using buckets; bucket feeding helps farmers to control the amount of milk calves are taking each day (which prevents diseases like scours) and is also helpful when a cow dies and leaves calves behind.  It may not be easy to train calves how to drink from a bucket so it is important to start early. The first few days of bucket feeding are the most important so farmers should make sure that the calf gets enough milk at this time. Bucket feeding should be started when calves are between 2 to 3 days old. Farmers should keep weighing calves because this helps them know how much milk to give the calves at different stages. In the first 2 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/10 of their body weight and feeding should be done 3 times a day. In the next 3 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/5 of their body weight and feeding should be done 2 times a day.

Many parts of the animal are economically valuable for a variety of purposes such as the skins for leather. All female goats (does) that have produced kids should give milk. Goat milk compares favourably in nutritive value with cow's milk. It is used extensively in making cheeses. Goat milk is valued for the elderly,  sick,  babies,  children with allergies  and patients with ulcers. Goats are a source of meat and skins  contributing much to the social and economic life of people. Milk goats are definitely the way forward for the small farmer. They not only take up less space in respect of both housing and grazing  especially if they are to be kept on nil grazing  but they eat less than a cow and will produce as much if not more milk than the average rural cow.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet/Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diagnosis of sick animals","id":"a0r70000000StICAA0","content":"The early awareness of sickness in animals is important to successful treatment. The longer an animal is sick the more difficult it will be to cure. \nEarly signs of sickness in goats are: \n - Stops eating and drinking  \n - Becomes dehydrated  \n - The temperature rises  \n - Respiration rate increases  \n - The animal becomes dull and lags behind the others   \n - The coat becomes rough and looses its shine. \n\nObserve sick animals by doing the following: \n - Take its temperature  \n - observe if it coughs  signs of wounds  diarrohea.  \n\nDehydration (lack of liquid in the body) can kill the animal  provide the animal with shelter and plenty of clean drinking water. A thin porridge made with any clean grain flour and boiled up with a bit of salt  sugar or honey and cooled is a good supplement to feed a sick goat to provide energy.  Depending on the size of the goat they can be given up to 4 bottles a day at regular intervals. Alternatively make a rehydration solution from 1 liter of boiled water,  4 tablespoons of honey or sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt and give as a drench. A sick goat will respond better to treatment in the company of another goat. \n\nIn the case of constipation a very simple remedy is 1 egg / 250 grams sugar beaten well together and fed slowly to the goat with a syringe. If symptoms persist  consult your vet.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet/Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Vitamins","id":"a0r70000000StIDAA0","content":"Vitamins are essential food substances and are required in very small quantities.

The first 35 days of their life are very important. Young rabbits are usually not allowed to get out of the nest for atleast 2 weeks or even longer. Young rabbits should not be separated from their mother before they are 4 weeks old since this may make them die from separation shock. The young rabbits should not be allowed to get cold especially in the first few days after they are born. Farmers should check the nest to make sure that the young rabbits are not carried out of the nest by the mother after she feeds them (check the nest in early morning since feeding normally takes place during the night). It is safe for farmers to handle the young and return them to the nest. If young rabbits are found outside they should be warmed up quickly(by wrapping them lightly in a cloth and putting this on top of a plastic bottle filled with hot water. The young rabbits and the bottle filled with hot water should be placed in a box. They must be protected from the plastic cover of the hot water bottle and they should be turned several times to make sure that they are properly warm). If young rabbits are not warmed up when they are cold they can die.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Finding out sex of young rabbits","id":"a0r70000000StIVAA0","content":"When the young rabbits are 1 month old (they are weaned off their mother at this age)  female and male rabbits should be separated and put into different houses. This is done to prevent them from starting mating at an early age. The separation of male and female rabbits is known as sexing and it can be done by laying the baby rabbit on its back in the farmer's hand and gently blowing on the hair around the rabbit's genital area; the farmer should then use 2 fingers to gently separate the genitalia towards the tail. Male rabbits have a small upwards swelling while female rabbits have a small opening. The process of sexing is easier to do by two people with one holding the rabbit while the other person finds out the sex of the rabbit. Young rabbits usually lie very still when laid on their backs. It is very important to handle them gently to avoid injuring them.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to care for weaning rabbits","id":"a0r70000000StIWAA0","content":"Young rabbits should be weaned when they are 1 month old. Female and male rabbits should be separated and put in different houses. At weaning  farmers should treat the young rabbits with coccidiostat (the same one used for chicken). Farmers should also mix 1 ml of dawa into 1 litre of water and provide it for the young rabbits to drink to protect them from diarrhoea and stress after weaning.   Farmers should also deworm young rabbits 1 week after weaning them (deworming can be done with 1/4ml of Albendazole administered by mouth with a small syringe (without needle)for each 1 month old rabbit). When deworming the syringe should not be pushed too far into the rabbits mouth since this may damage their throats. Rabbits which are handled roughly can easily die.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Parasites","id":"a0r70000000StJiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StJjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StJkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of local cattle","id":"a0r70000000StJlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StJmAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StJnAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Parasites","id":"a0r70000000StJoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Milking","id":"a0r70000000StJqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing dairy cattle","id":"a0r70000000StJsAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StJtAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing","id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRHAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Organic Farming","id":"a0r70000000StRMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:19\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRHAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Inorganic Farming","id":"a0r70000000StRNAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:19\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Ssi6AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bonio","id":"a0r70000000SsnhAAC","content":"Chelimo David  Location: Bonio  Contacts: 784672048 Buys: Maize  Chemutai solomon Location: Bonio Contacts: 782906615 Buys: Coffee\n\nAttribution: Information provided by GF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Ssi7AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Senendet village","id":"a0r70000000SsniAAC","content":"Somikwo Jackson Location: Senendet village Contacts: 75189596 Buys: Maize ,and cabbages\n\nAttribution: Information provided by GF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SshsAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Byebega","id":"a0r70000000SsnjAAC","content":"Akweteireho Steven  Location: Byebega  Contacts: 784810280 Buys: Maize, Beans\n\nAttribution: Information provided by GF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Ssi8AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rukoki trading center","id":"a0r70000000SsnkAAC","content":"Rosemary.

NOTE that pineapples are low in sugar content and unripe pineapples do not ripen after harvest. Generally the fruits are mature and ready for harvest when they snap off at the bending of the fruit and these can be stored/ transported to distant markets. Fresh fruits destined for the local market are plucked when almost ripe while those destined for export are harvested when beginning to turn yellow-green at the fruit base. They are cut off with a sharp knife, leaving a stem which is later trimmed to 3.4cm. Some times ripeness and quality can be judged by snapping a finger against the side of the fruit. A good, ripe fruit gives a dull, solid sound while immaturity and poor quality fruits give a hollow knock. Harvested fruits can be stored up to 4-6 weeks at 7°C. NEVER bruise fruits as this will cause rotting and lower quality. The pineapple plants usually produce for about four years.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Growth Disorders","id":"a0r70000000StVMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StVNAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop Management","id":"a0r70000000StVOAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"For more Information","id":"a0r70000000StVPAA0","content":"For more information on improved varieties, contact National Agricultural Research Organisation(NARO), National Crops Resesources Research Institute_Namulonge.

A maize farmer can improve fertility of the soil in which maize was planted by adding fertilizers to the soil, crop rotation, controlling soil erosion, mulching to conserve soil moisture, controlling weeds, breaking the hard layers on top of soil to let water easily enter soil, reducing amount of disturbance of the soil to help protect moisture and organic matter in the soil.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-10 11:17:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil infertility","id":"a0r70000000StZwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves are wrinkled and seedlings become stunted and die","id":"a0r70000000StZxAAK","content":"Cotton attacked by aphids may have curls and wrinkles on leaves.

Farmers can repeatedly add fertiliser to soil after harvesting to help restore nutrients that have been lost from the soil  nutrients that have been used up by the passion fruit trees and to increase the speed at which young branches grow since these young branches later on produce fruit. Adding manure to soil in passion fruit gardens also helps to control the effect of viruses on the growth of passion fruits (Since plants have a high level of nutrition they wont be strongly affected by virus attacks). Passion fruit flowers may die if the soil does not have enough potassium and farmers can avoid this by adding manure to the soil. Adding manure to soil also increases soil's ability to hold moisture and promotes continuous growth in plants. Inorganic fertilizers such as NPK (17:17:17)  NPK (10:5:20  at 1.36 kg per plant 4 times a year) and Murate can also be used (get instructions from stockists on how to use these fertilisers).

Pruning also helps to expose pests to their enemies like predators  and to unfavorable conditions like strong sunshine  rain and wind  it helps to disentangle the holdings of the tendrils so that each of the branches hangs on its own for ease of management and pruning  helps to ensure that important parts of the plant get enough nutrients which helps these parts to produce big high quality marketable fruits. Ensure that only one shoot is led to the support wire. When pruning  allow the terminal shoot to grow above the support wire by about 10 cm  and then cut off the bud. This will stimulate production of lateral branches and the farmer should select only two of them and try making each one to grow towards the pole. As they grow along the wire attached to the support poles  they will also produce other branches. These branches should be helped to hang by disentangling the holdings of the tendrils. If this is not done  the branches will tie up resulting in poor exposure of leaves to sunshine  poor exposure of flowers to pollinators  raising temperatures of the plant that may start the out break of brown spot disease and makes pruning difficult.

Removing weeds also eases general crop management  eliminates risk of fire in dry weeds  lowers risk of rats and rodent attacks. Farmers can control weeds in passion fruits by ring hoeing around the passion fruit plants (the circle dug around the passion fruit plant should be 1.5 m in diameter) and slashing the rest of the area or by spraying herbicides (herbicides should be sprayed away from passion fruit plants and they should be applied in a manner that wind does not blow herbicide to the passion fruits). Farmers should only apply herbicides like Propanil that will only kill weed parts in contact or Butachlor and 2 4-D that will kill whole weed plants after single point contact. Farmers should be careful when removing weeds from passion fruit gardens since injuries to the base of the vines may allow entrance of disease causing organisms.

which are shallow and can easily be damaged).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

The best way to do this may be by removing the mother from the pig house and leaving piglets in an area they are used to for some time. Weaning should be done slowly over a 4 day period by reducing food given to the female pig each day to just 3 kg since this will help to make it stop producing milk for the piglets. Farmers can also practice split weaning and this is done by removing all piglets that are above average size from the litter at the end of the 5th week and allowing small piglets to suckle for an extra 4 to 5 days. This gives small piglets a chance to take more milk and add on extra weight. Piglets which are above 8 weeks old should not be allowed to suckle milk from their mother (this helps them gain weight and strength to fight diseases).

If there is a pig which has given birth within 3 days then farmers should adjust litter size to match the number of functioning teats or ability of the pig to produce milk. Farmers should move larger piglets to a foster female pig (this should be done before piglets are 3 days old). Farmers should make sure that piglets have received the first milk from their real mother before they are moved to another female pig. Female pigs can sometimes identify their own piglets from others using their smell and they may use this to refuse other piglets given to them which are not their own; to avoid this, farmers piglets should try hiding the smell of the piglets so that the mother cannot identify its young and this can be done by smearing all the piglets including her own piglets with a strong smelling substance like iodine or soaking all the piglets thoroughly in a salt solution.

However nitrogen fertilizer tends to reduce oil percentage of the seed  change the amino acid balance  and increase leaf area of the plant. Yield increases when up to 80kg/acre of Nitrogen fertilizer are applied. Nitrogen recommendations in dryer regions can be made from estimates of nitrate nitrogen in the soil (contact NARO for soils analysis). In the wetter regions recommendations are based upon soil organic matter and previous crop history  and it is recommended to apply 8kg Nitrogen /acre after fallow  27kg Nitrogen /acre after small grain and 36 to 45kg Nitrogen /acre after corn. On higher organic matter soils  amounts should be lowered. Nitrogen can be supplied from mineral or non-mineral sources (manures and legume stover  compost). Row placement of Phosphorus and potassium may be important in sunflower for maximizing efficiency of fertilizer use  as it is with many species. Recommendations for applications of Phosphorus and potassium should be made from soil tests and the yield goal for each field. Apply extra phosphorus and potassium when the flower bud begins to develop  to promote bigger blooms. Recommendations range from 18 to 32kg/acre P2O5 and 27 to 64kg/acre K2O for soils testing very low in Phosphorus or potassium  depending on soil yield potential. These recommendations decrease as soil test Phosphorus and/or potassium increase.

Another sign is trees having the root collar or bark of trees found at or just below ground level eaten up and when the affected tree is pulled up many of the tree's roots will also have been eaten. Ways of controlling termites include using healthy and vigorous seedlings when planting, planting early in the rainy season, ensuring seedlings are watered well immediately before planting out, planting eucalyptus types which are resistant to termites and mixing dusban with nursery soil or putting it into planting holes when planting. Farmers can also control termites by spraying using insecticides like chlorpyrifos, isofenphos, permethrin, carbofuran, carbosulfan and decamethrin. Another way to control termites is by destroying their mound, removing the queen and spraying them with insecticide.

Land clearing usually leaves alot of plant material lying around and the best way to clear it is by having a controlled, cool burn. Burning will be more successful if the cleared vegetation has been left to dry after it is cut and if the cleared material is collected into piles rather than being scattered through out the whole area. Farmers should be careful to burn cleared vegetation when conditions are favourable (do not burn on windy days and have enough people with fire fighting equipment ready so that they can put out the incase it becomes uncontrolled.)\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luweero","id":"a0r70000000Su5yAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buikwe","id":"a0r70000000Su5zAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nwoya","id":"a0r70000000Su60AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su61AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su62AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rubirizi","id":"a0r70000000Su63AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mitooma","id":"a0r70000000Su64AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buhweju","id":"a0r70000000Su65AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sheema","id":"a0r70000000Su66AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pader","id":"a0r70000000Su67AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bushenyi","id":"a0r70000000Su68AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kitgum","id":"a0r70000000Su69AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Agago","id":"a0r70000000Su6AAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mukono","id":"a0r70000000Su6BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nakaseke","id":"a0r70000000Su6CAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su6DAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4RAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Oyam","id":"a0r70000000Su6EAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su6FAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Choosing the right seeds","id":"a0r70000000StlsAAC","content":"You choose the type of seeds to plant by considering the seeds' resistance to diseases and hard weather conditions like drought and heavy rains, how long they take to mature, how much buyers like them, the climate of your area and how much yield the seeds can give.Farmers growing beans to feed the family may prefer bean types that cook faster while a farmer growing beans for sale may plant bean types that are on high demand in the market.

Signs of chalkbrood include young ones of bees (larvae) becoming chalk white and being covered with cotton like hairs. The white colour of young ones will start changing to gray or black. Infected or dead young ones of bees may be seen at the hive entrance. Prevention and control: Beekeepers should improve ventilation (flow of air) in hives to avoid moisture collecting in the hives; ventilation can be improved by making more holes on the hive. Old black brood combs (where the young ones of bees are kept) should be destroyed because they may be having organisms which cause chalkbrood disease.

The farmer should then remove seedlings from the plastic coverings and place the seedlings upright in the planting holes making sure that atleast 2 cm of the stem will be covered by soil (farmers should make sure that seedlings are planted uppright and not bent or at an angle in the soil). The farmer should replace soil in the hole around the roots making sure that the seedling and roots remain in an upright position. The soil which has been placed in the hole should then be firmed with hands (not feet) and this is done by pushing the soil down and in but not with too much force).\nAnother way of planting is called water planting and it involves adding water to the newly planted seedlings. This type of planting gives seedlings an excellent start and leads to very high survival rates but it is expensive and requires alot of work to get water to the planting site to keep up with the planting.

Liquid manure is made by soaking 50kg of cattle, goat or poultry manure in 150 litres of water for 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks dilute the liquid with 300 litres of water and pour half a litre around each plant. Do not pour the manure on the plant.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYNAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site selection","id":"a0r70000000StmHAAS","content":"Cotton grows well in warm areas with enough sunshine.

Tanning skins and manufacturing leather products adds 5 to 10 times value to the skins. In hot humid conditions skin rotting occurs quickly and spoils the skin. \nThe first stage in the preservation of fresh skins is known as curing and there are 2 simple methods of skin curing. \n1.  Air-drying: - The wet skin is either  pegged out on the ground or tied to a frame and dried upright. It is important to avoid any damage to the skin and to try not to spoil the edges through clumsy pegging or tying. In climates that are not too humid  skins can be cured in 1-2 days. \n2. Salt Curing: - The fresh skin is cleaned of any blood or dirt  and washed with clean water. It is laid out with the inside facing upwards. Salt equivalent to 40 % of its weight is sprinkled on to it  until it is covered in an even layer. The salt will serve both to reduce its water content and to prevent bacterial development. The skin can be folded with the salted side inside and kept in this way for long periods before tanning. \n3. The advanced form of skin processing is leather tanning. There are different types of leather that can be produce from goatskins. Vegetable tanned leather: this has the most potential for rural area tanning.
