matter in the main garden before transplanting. This is added into the soil to derive maximum benefits. The plants must start off and grow fast after transplanting or they start producing flowers and set fruit while they are too small.If plants develop flowers too early, pluck off these flowers sothe plant can grow to the right size. A reasonable recommendation is to supply 4,048-8,097kg/acre of organic matter. General nutrient requirements are 24-40 kgs Nitrogen, 4 kgs phosphorous, 40 kg potash.This should be applied in bits during the growing season. Therefore, a balanced nutrient level is required for maximum production.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYeAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storage","id":"a0r70000000StmdAAC","content":"Commercially, apples can be stored for some months in rooms with higher amounts of carbon dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ripening from moving too quickly. For home storage, most varieties of apple can be kept for close to two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (that is below 5 ï¿½C). Apples keep for longest in cool conditions (3C / 36F), which are well-ventilated, dark and slightly humid.Not many of us can provide these ideal conditions, so a compromise is necessary. A good option is to store the apples in a shed or open room, with the apples in plastic bags to retain moisture - leave a 2.5cm (1in) hole in each bag to allow some air movement.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO,NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Holes in leaves","id":"a0r70000000StmeAAC","content":"This is Winter moth.Signs include holes in leaves which will spread disease to tree and weaken it.

can also be fed using using buckets; bucket feeding helps farmers to control the amount of milk calves are taking each day (which prevents diseases like scours) and is also helpful when a cow dies and leaves calves behind.  It may not be easy to train calves how to drink from a bucket so it is important to start early. The first few days of bucket feeding are the most important so farmers should make sure that the calf gets enough milk at this time. Bucket feeding should be started when calves are between 2 to 3 days old. Farmers should keep weighing calves because this helps them know how much milk to give the calves at different stages. In the first 2 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/10 of their body weight and feeding should be done 3 times a day. In the next 3 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/5 of their body weight and feeding should be done 2 times a day. After 5 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/20 of their body weight until they are weaned and feeding should be done 2 times a day. Calves should be fed at the same time each day and milk should be given to calves immediately after it has been milked.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:15:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su9lAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Animal advice","id":"a0r70000000Su0SAAS","content":"Moses Tella Chemusto 0779465546.

After this, the container should be slowly lowered into the pond and bent gently so that the young fish can swim out of it and into the pond on their own.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to introduce young fish into a pond","id":"a0r70000000StJVAA0","content":"Fingerlings (young fish) should be introduced into a pond when they are 10 cm long; at this stage the young fish will not be easily eaten by snakes, frogs, birds and they cannot be greatly affected by changes in environmental conditions such as change in the water temperature. Sometimes farmers may not be able to get all the fish they want to put into a pond at once and if this happens farmers can add more fish into the pond later on BUT it should not take more than 2 weeks. If more fish is added after more than 2 weeks, then the fish that was put into the pond first may fight with the second group of fish which can cause stress for the newly introduced fish. Adding more young fish into the pond after 2 weeks have passed since the first group of young fish were introduced will also lead to getting fish of different sizes when fishing.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Transporting young fish","id":"a0r70000000StJWAA0","content":"Before being transported, young fish should not be fed for atleast 2 days and transferring them into the container in which they will be transported should be done during cold weather (like during the morning). The equipment used to pack and transport fish should have no sharp edges becausethese may injure the fish. All the equipment used to handle fish should be washed with very clean water after each time they are used. Fish farmers should only buy young fish from an experienced breeder to avoid death due to poor handling during breeding. Young fish should be transported in buckets or other plastic containers and these containers should not be covered completely. The containers in which fish is being transported should also not be exposed to the sun since this can make water warm which can lead to death of the fish. Young fish should be transported as quickly as possible since staying in the little water in the container for long can kill the young fish.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGeAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fish types kept in Uganda","id":"a0r70000000StJXAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGeAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to choose the type of fish to keep","id":"a0r70000000StJYAA0","content":"When choosing a type of fish to keep, farmers should select fish types that will easily accept and eat enough of the feeds provided, grow rapidly, reach market weight before they start reproducing and are not easily attacked by diseases.

This is done to prevent them from starting mating at an early age. The separation of male and female rabbits is known as sexing and it can be done by laying the baby rabbit on its back in the farmer's hand and gently blowing on the hair around the rabbit's genital area; the farmer should then use 2 fingers to gently separate the genitalia towards the tail. Male rabbits have a small upwards swelling while female rabbits have a small opening. The process of sexing is easier to do by two people with one holding the rabbit while the other person finds out the sex of the rabbit. Young rabbits usually lie very still when laid on their backs. It is very important to handle them gently to avoid injuring them.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to care for weaning rabbits","id":"a0r70000000StIWAA0","content":"Young rabbits should be weaned when they are 1 month old. Female and male rabbits should be separated and put in different houses. At weaning  farmers should treat the young rabbits with coccidiostat (the same one used for chicken). Farmers should also mix 1 ml of dawa into 1 litre of water and provide it for the young rabbits to drink to protect them from diarrhoea and stress after weaning.   Farmers should also deworm young rabbits 1 week after weaning them (deworming can be done with 1/4ml of Albendazole administered by mouth with a small syringe (without needle)for each 1 month old rabbit). When deworming the syringe should not be pushed too far into the rabbits mouth since this may damage their throats. Rabbits which are handled roughly can easily die.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Parasites","id":"a0r70000000StJiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StJjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-3015:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StJkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of local cattle","id":"a0r70000000StJlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StJmAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StJnAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Parasites","id":"a0r70000000StJoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Milking","id":"a0r70000000StJqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing dairy cattle","id":"a0r70000000StJsAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StJtAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing","id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Stature or physique","id":"a0r70000000StJvAAK","content":"The importance of animal stature or physique is related to udder.

Maize smut disease is common in dry, hot maize growing areas as well as mid hill areas with weather that is neither too hot or too cold. Signs of maize smut include maize cobs becoming swollen and with an abnormal shape, male flowers growing too big and abnormal in shape, black masses of powdery things developing inside male flowers and in the place of normal maize cobs. Maize cobs affected by maize smut disease may not develop any maize grains on the cob. Prevention and control: The best, easiest and cheapest way a farmer can fight maize smut disease is planting seed types which resist maize smut. Farmers should also remove the abnormal swellings from diseased maize plants as soon as they are seen but it may be best to completely remove the whole maize plant which is affected. When digging farmers should be careful not to make any cuts on maize plants and they should fight any pests since smut enters through cuts on the maize plant or holes left by pests. Other ways to control smut include crop rotation, keeping maize fields clean, removing and destroying smut swellings on maize plants immediately they are seen (this helps to reduce presence of the disease in the next season).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves having grey greenish long spots that look like cigarettes","id":"a0r70000000StZZAA0","content":"This disease is called turcicum leaf blight and it often occurs in areas which usually have heavy, frequent rain, high humidity and low temperature during maize growing seasons. Damage to maize may be serious if the disease occurs before or at flowering stage, before or at silking stage or if conditions that favor the disease are present. Signs of turcicum leaf blight include slightly oval water-soaked small spots produced on leaves. The spots are dark and greyish-green in colour and as time goes on they become bigger and long shaped like cigarettes. They may appear first on lower leaves and increase in number as maize plants develop and the spots may join and form large areas which can kill maize leaves. Heavily infected leaves appear dry as if affected by drought. Prevention and control: To control the disease, farmers should plant resistant maize types, and fields which have been affected by the disease should be rotated withnon cereal crops like sunflower, soybean for atleast 1 year. When carrying out crop rotation farmers must rotate maize with crops which cannot be affected by turcicum leaf blight disease. Farmers should not plant maize if maize which was in the garden during the previous season was attacked by turcicum leaf blight. Leftover parts of plants which were attacked by turcicum leaf blight should be buried soon after harvest so that they can rot quickly and prevent the disease from occuring again. Farmers can also get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which fungicides to use and when to spray maize (it is usually best to spray when spots first become visible on the lower leaves) in order to effectively control turcicum leaf blight.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaves having rectangularelongated brownish gray dead spots running parallel to leaf veins","id":"a0r70000000StZaAAK","content":"This disease is called gray leaf spot and is caused by some types of fungi. The disease may increase in maize if a farmer does little ploughing or digging in a maize garden. Gray leaf spot develops quickly if maize is in conditions of high humidity and when its leaves stay wet for long. Maize which has gray leaf spot may have its leaves start to look like they are very old immediately after flowering and grains found on the maize cobs will be of poor quality. Signs of the disease include leaves having small scratches or dead areas surrounded by yellow which are visible when the leaf is held up against the sun and within about 2 weeks these spots become rectangular elongated brown gray dead spots growing parallel to the leaf veins. These gray dead spots may join and make the whole affected leaf dry up and die. Prevention and control: Farmers should plant maize seeds which are resistant to diseases, avoid moisture or wetness getting onto the leaf surfaces (for example irrigation should be done late in the afternoon or early evening especially after it is seen that gray leaf spot disease has attacked the maize garden). The disease can be controlled by planting maize seeds which are resistant to the disease and keeping the maize garden clean. Farmers can also use some chemicals (fungicides) to control gray leaf spot but they MUST always get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which chemical to use when fighting gray leaf spot disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Very small scattered spots on youngest leaves white to yellowish narrow broken lines running parrallel along leaves","id":"a0r70000000StZbAAK","content":"This disease is called maize streak and it is caused by a virus which is spread by leafhoppers after they have fed on maize plants which have the disease. Leafhoppers that have fed on infected plants can carry and spread the maize streak virus for a long time. Maize streak can also be found in wild grasses and many cereal crops. Signs of maize streak disease include very small round scattered spots in the youngest leaves of maize plants which start appearing on the youngest leaves within a week after maize has been infected with the virus. The number of spots increases as the plant grows and they enlarge into narrow broken lines running parallel to the leaf veins.With time the spots become very many at leaf bases and fully grown leaves lose their green colour developing broken yellow lines along the leaf veins. Infected maize may grow slowly and if it is affected early it will not develop cobs or will die while it is still very young. Prevention and control: Farmers should plant maize seeds which are resistant to diseases (disease resistant maize seeds can be got from most farm input supplier shops).

Fresh fruits destined for the local market are plucked when almost ripe while those destined for export are harvested when beginning to turn yellow-green at the fruit base. They are cut off with a sharp knife, leaving a stem which is later trimmed to 3.4cm. Some times ripeness and quality can be judged by snapping a finger against the side of the fruit. A good, ripe fruit gives a dull, solid sound while immaturity and poor quality fruits give a hollow knock. Harvested fruits can be stored up to 4-6 weeks at 7ï¿½C.

The seeds to be planted should be removed from the fruit by squeezing  rubbed free of pulp and they should be dried in a shade before planting. It usually takes passion fruit seeds 2 to 4 weeks to germinate. Fresh seeds are much easier to germinate than seeds older than one or two months. Older seeds can be soaked for at least one day to improve germination. The soft sticky substance around the seeds should be brittle and dry to increase chances of seeds germinating. Sprouting may be quickened by allowing the pulp to ferment for a few days before separating seeds from the fruit.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWQAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Seed bed preparation","id":"a0r70000000StgMAAS","content":"When preparing a seedbed for passion fruit  farmers should cultivate a 1meter wide and 10 meters long area.

The rate at which passion fruits grow and the amount of yield harvested depend on how fertile the soil is. Farmerscan improve soil fertility by adding fertilisers and the best fertilisers to add is organic manure (like cow dung  compost  chicken liter). Farmers can repeatedly add fertiliser to soil after harvesting to help restore nutrients that have been lost from the soil  nutrients that have been used up by the passion fruit trees and to increase the speed at which young branches grow since these young branches later on produce fruit. Adding manure to soil in passion fruit gardens also helps to controlthe effect of viruses on the growth of passion fruits (Since plants have a high level of nutrition they wont be strongly affected by virus attacks). Passion fruit flowers may die if the soil does not have enough potassium and farmers can avoid this by adding manure to the soil. Adding manure to soil also increases soil's ability to hold moisture and promotes continuous growth in plants. Inorganic fertilizers such as NPK (17:17:17)  NPK (10:5:20  at 1.36 kg per plant 4 times a year) and Murate can also be used (get instructions from stockists on how to use these fertilisers). NPK increases growth of new shoots and fruit quality while Murate of potash will also improve fruit quality.Application of 0.9 to 1kg of nitrogen results into 30 kg of fruits  but excessive nitrogen will cause passion fruits to fall off trees before they are fully grown.

Pruning also helps to expose pests to their enemies like predators  and to unfavorable conditions like strong sunshine  rain and wind  it helps to disentangle the holdings of the tendrils so that each of the branches hangs on its own for ease of management and pruning  helps toensure that important parts of the plant get enough nutrients which helps these parts to produce big high quality marketable fruits. Ensure that only one shoot is led to the support wire. When pruning  allow the terminal shoot to grow above the support wire by about 10 cm  and then cut off the bud. This will stimulate production of lateral branches and the farmer should select only two of them and try making each one to grow towards the pole. As they grow along the wire attached to the supportpoles  they will also produce other branches. These branches should be helped to hang by disentangling the holdings of the tendrils. If this is not done  the branches will tie up resulting in poor exposure of leaves to sunshine  poor exposure of flowers to pollinators  raising temperatures of the plant that may start the out break of brown spot disease and makes pruning difficult. ALWAYS disinfect tools every after pruning a plant to prevent disease spread from one plant to another. Dip tools inJIK after working on each plant  heat tools in flame or use alcohol methanol to clean them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed control","id":"a0r70000000StgWAAS","content":"Weeds are dangerous to passion fruits since they harbor pests and diseases  compete with plants for nutrients leading to low yields. Removing weeds from passion fruits helps eliminate hosts of mites and other passion fruit pests (like mites  aphids  white flies and thrips)  lowers competition for nutrients and water  eliminates risk of diverting away beneficial insects (like bees which help pollinate passion fruits). Removing weeds also eases general crop management  eliminates risk of fire in dry weeds  lowers risk of rats and rodent attacks. Farmers can control weeds in passion fruits by ring hoeing around the passion fruit plants (the circle dug around the passion fruit plant should be 1.5 m in diameter) and slashing the rest of the area or by spraying herbicides (herbicides should be sprayed away from passion fruit plants and they should be applied in a manner that wind does not blow herbicide to the passion fruits). Farmers should only apply herbicides like Propanil that will only kill weed parts in contact or Butachlor and 2 4-D that will kill whole weed plants after single point contact. Farmers should be careful when removing weeds from passion fruit gardens since injuries to the base of the vines may allow entrance of disease causing organisms. Damaging passion fruit vines during weeding can be avoided by hand weeding or the application of herbicides around the main passion fruit stems (these practices will also protect passion fruit roots which are shallow and can easily be damaged).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

The waste collected from pig houses can be applied in crop gardens and when placed in the garden the pig waste should be covered with a layer of soil to avoid loss of nutrients, bad smells and gathering of flies. Farmers should make a pit into which pig wastes are emptied on a daily basis and it should be close to the pig house to reduce labour requirement. The pit made can bea concrete pit or a simple earth pit and it should be covered. The pit is emptied at different times depending on the capacity of waste it can hold.

Most pig farmers in Uganda do not carry weaning early because it requires an expensive diet for the piglets and needs farmers to provide alot of care. The best way to do this may be by removing the mother from the pig house and leaving piglets in an area they are used to for some time. Weaning should be done slowly over a 4 day period by reducing food given to the female pig each day to just 3 kg since this will help to make it stop producing milk for the piglets. Farmers can also practice split weaning and this is done by removing all piglets that are above average size from the litter at the end of the 5th week and allowing small piglets to suckle for an extra 4 to 5 days. This gives small piglets a chance to take more milk and add on extra weight. Piglets which are above 8 weeks old should not be allowed to suckle milk from their mother (this helps them gain weight and strength to fight diseases). Carrying out split weaning helps farmers to reduce the number of times piglets suckle milk from their mother which helps her come back to heat early after weaning.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fostering","id":"a0r70000000StHBAA0","content":"Fostering means giving piglets to another female pig which is not their own mother especially if their own mother dies while giving birth, falls sick when giving birth and cannot produce milk, produces more piglets than the number of teats she has, or if she produces an excessively large litter and produces very little milk. Ifthere is a pig which has given birth within 3 days then farmers should adjust litter size to match the number of functioning teats or ability of the pig to produce milk. Farmers should move larger piglets to a foster female pig (this should be done before piglets are 3 days old). Farmers should make sure that piglets have received the first milk from their real mother before they are moved to another female pig. Female pigs can sometimes identify their own piglets from others using their smelland they may use this to refuse other piglets given to them which are not their own; to avoid this, farmers piglets should try hiding the smell of the piglets so that the mother cannot identify its young and this can be done by smearing all the piglets including her own piglets with a strong smelling substance like iodine or soaking all the piglets thoroughly in a salt solution.

In dry areas (and especially in soil which has a rough texture and is infertile), farmers should leave wide spaces between pigeon pea plants to reduce competition. Pigeon pea plants are usually slow in starting to grow and this explains why farmers need to control weeds for the first 2 months if pigeon peas are to grow well. Once pigeon plants are established they grow well on their own. Farmers usually need between 8 to 10 kg of pigeon pea seeds to plant one acre.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWUAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weeding","id":"a0r70000000StgaAAC","content":"Since pigeon pea plants grow slowly in the first 2 months after they are planted, farmers should control weeds during this time to enable the pigeon peas to grow well.

In Uganda  pigeon peas are usually grown in alternate rows with simsim or African finger millet since pigeon peas help to increase growth of such crops.

Ear rot disease attacks maize passing through holes made by pests like earworms, borers and birds when they are feeding. Maize suffering from ear rot may be harmful to feed to birds like chicken. Signs of ear rot include pink andreddish colour on maize cobs and grains, maize cobs developing irregular discoloured areas on husks. The discoloured areas enlarge until the husks become completely dried although the maize plant is still green. If husks are removed the maize ears appear chaffy and discoloured with a white cotton-like growth between maize grains. Late in the season many small black things (fungi) form on maize grains and cobs. Maize cobs which are heavily affected by ear rot are light in weight. Infection oftenoccurs through the stem and moves from cob to grains. \n\nPrevention and control: To prevent ear rot, farmers should plant maize seed types which are resistant to diseases.  Farmers can control ear rot by fighting pests that attack maize since holes made by these pests as they feed can lead to ear rot.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StTgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"White fungal growth on plants causing decaying","id":"a0r70000000StaJAAS","content":"Cabbage blight is caused by fungus.

The rabbit house should have a layer of dried grass as bedding; this is important because the rabbits also eat the dry grass at night. The rabbit house should be located in a place which is protected from the wind (rabbits are affected by wind). The rabbit house should be  cleaned everyday; wet bedding should be removed and replaced with dry material (wet bedding will encourage flies and diseases to attack rabbits). Dirty or wet houses will result in a very strong rabbit smell in the meat of rabbits when they are slaughtered.

Bruchids can cause very high losses in pigeon peas after harvesting if the farmer does not try to control them. Control:  Farmers should harvest pigeon pea pods as soon as they mature and pigeon pea seeds should be dried in the sun before they are stored (and they should be stored in clean containers which cannot allow beetles to enter). Farmers can also cover pigeon pea seeds with a layer of edible oil (cooking oil) or clean, undisturbed clay (inert clay) to prevent further development of bruchids in stored seeds. Another way to keep away bruchids is by mixing wood ash in pigeon pea seeds stored for food or planting (seeds for planting canalso be protected by mixing them with chillies or exposing them to smoke from cooking fires).

However nitrogen fertilizer tends to reduce oil percentage of the seed  change the amino acid balance  and increase leaf area of the plant. Yield increases when up to 80kg/acre of Nitrogen fertilizer are applied. Nitrogen recommendations in dryer regions can be made from estimates of nitrate nitrogen in the soil (contact NARO for soils analysis). In the wetter regions recommendations are based upon soil organic matter and previous crop history  and it is recommended to apply 8kg Nitrogen /acre after fallow  27kg Nitrogen /acre after small grain and 36 to 45kg Nitrogen /acre after corn. On higher organic matter soils  amounts should be lowered. Nitrogen can be supplied from mineral or non-mineral sources (manures and legume stover  compost). Row placement of Phosphorus and potassium may be important in sunflower for maximizing efficiency of fertilizer use  as it is with many species. Recommendations for applications of Phosphorus and potassium should be made from soil tests and the yield goal for each field. Apply extra phosphorus and potassium when the flower bud begins to develop  to promote bigger blooms. Recommendations range from 18 to 32kg/acre P2O5 and 27 to 64kg/acre K2O for soils testing very low in Phosphorus or potassium  depending on soil yield potential. These recommendations decrease as soil test Phosphorus and/or potassium increase. Response to Phosphorus is not expected if soil Phosphorus exceeds 13kg/acre nor to potassium if the potassium tests is greater than 136kg/acre.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWbAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Intercropping","id":"a0r70000000StguAAC","content":"Sunflower can be grown as a pure stand but can also be intercroped with other anuals especially legumes (Beans  Soya beans).\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWcAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Birds","id":"a0r70000000StgvAAC","content":"One of the most serious constraints to sunflower production in Uganda is birds.

Another sign is trees having the root collar or bark of trees found at or just below ground level eaten up and when the affected tree is pulled up many of the tree's roots will also have been eaten. Ways of controlling termites include using healthy and vigorous seedlings when planting, planting early in the rainy season, ensuring seedlings are watered well immediately before planting out, planting eucalyptus types which are resistant to termites and mixing dusban with nursery soil or putting it into planting holes when planting. Farmers can also control termites by spraying using insecticides like chlorpyrifos, isofenphos, permethrin, carbofuran, carbosulfan and decamethrin. Another way to control termites is by destroying their mound, removing the queen and spraying them with insecticide. FARMERS SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL when using pesticides since many of them are poisonous.

Land clearing usually leaves alot of plant material lying around and the best way to clear it is by having a controlled, cool burn. Burning will be more successful if the cleared vegetation has been left to dry after it is cut and if the cleared material is collected into piles rather than being scattered through out the whole area. Farmers should be careful to burn cleared vegetation when conditions are favourable (do notburn on windy days and have enough people with fire fighting equipment ready so that they can put out the incase it becomes uncontrolled.)\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luweero","id":"a0r70000000Su5yAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buikwe","id":"a0r70000000Su5zAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nwoya","id":"a0r70000000Su60AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su61AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su62AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rubirizi","id":"a0r70000000Su63AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mitooma","id":"a0r70000000Su64AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buhweju","id":"a0r70000000Su65AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sheema","id":"a0r70000000Su66AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pader","id":"a0r70000000Su67AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bushenyi","id":"a0r70000000Su68AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kitgum","id":"a0r70000000Su69AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Agago","id":"a0r70000000Su6AAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mukono","id":"a0r70000000Su6BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nakaseke","id":"a0r70000000Su6CAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su6DAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4RAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Oyam","id":"a0r70000000Su6EAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su6FAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Choosing the right seeds","id":"a0r70000000StlsAAC","content":"You choose the type of seeds to plant by considering the seeds' resistance to diseases and hard weather conditions like drought and heavy rains, how long they take to mature, how much buyers like them, the climate of your area and how much yield the seeds can give.Farmers growing beans to feed the family may prefer bean types that cook faster while a farmer growing beans for sale may plant bean types that are on high demand in the market.

Robusta seeds are processed from fully ripe and healthy fruits and they are supplied as parchment (which is sometimes dressed with ash). There are some other robusta coffee types that are resistant to coffee wilt disease and farmers are advised to plant these types; they include: Kituuza R1, Kituuza R2, KituzaR3, Kituza R4, Kituza R5, Kituza R5 Kituza R6 and Kituza R7. The Nganda and Erecta types of robusta coffee have been cross bred to create clonal coffee types like IS/2, IS/3, IS/6, 257S/53, 258S/24 & 223/32; these clonal coffee types have large coffee beans, produce high yields at harvest time, give good quality coffee and are resistant to diseases like coffee leaf rust and red blister disease.\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Black angular marks on the","id":"a0r70000000Stm2AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowing of leaves and dropping of seeds and leaves","id":"a0r70000000Stm3AAC","content":"This is Cotton fusarium wilt which is caused by a fungi.

The seed rate varies depending on seed type but ranges from 45kg per hectare for small seeded to 90 kg per hectare for large seeded.  Beans are planted at a depth of 2 to 3cm and not deeper than 5cm. Deeper planting may lead to low germination and rotting while shallow planting in case of low moisture leads to poor germination and exposes seeds to predators.A fine seed bed is essential to ensure proper growth right from germination.

Young gilts should be allowed to see a boar at least 2 times a day and farmers should observe them for signs of heat at least 2 times a day.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Problems which reduce productivity of male pigs","id":"a0r70000000StHIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Methods of mating","id":"a0r70000000StHJAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Number of female pigs a male pig can mate with","id":"a0r70000000StHKAA0","content":"The number of female pigs (sows) that a male pig (boar) can mate with usually depends on the age of the boar.

Tanning skins and manufacturing leather products adds 5 to 10 times value to the skins. In hot humid conditions skin rotting occurs quickly and spoils the skin. \nThe first stage in the preservation of fresh skins is known as curing and there are 2 simple methods of skin curing. \n1.  Air-drying: - The wet skin is either  pegged out on the ground or tied to a frame and dried upright. It is important to avoid any damage to the skin and to try not to spoil the edges through clumsy pegging or tying. In climates that are not too humid  skins can be cured in 1-2 days. \n2. Salt Curing: - The fresh skin is cleaned of any blood or dirt  and washed with clean water. It is laid out with the inside facing upwards. Salt equivalent to 40 % of its weight is sprinkled on to it  until it is covered in an even layer. The salt will serve both to reduce its water content and to prevent bacterial development. The skin can be folded with the salted side inside and kept in this way for long periods before tanning. \n3. The advanced form of skin processing is leather tanning. There are different types of leather that can be produce from goatskins. Vegetable tanned leather: this has the most potential for rural area tanning. Book binding leather, Clothing leather,  Glove type of leather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet/Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preservation of meat","id":"a0r70000000StHiAAK","content":"Goats that are slaughtered are consumed immediately.

After soaking the fertilizer, fish farmers can apply the fertilizer by either lowering the bag into the water in a corner of the pond or scattering the manure in the pond.

The manure should be applied between 10:00 am (in the morning) and 4:00 pm (in the afternoon) because this is when there is enough oxygen in the water. The fertilizer gives water in the pond a green colour and this makes it hard for snakes, birds and lizards to see and attack the fish.

Fish feeds should be put in the pond between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm because this is when oxygen levels in the water are high (high oxygen levels help the fish to feed well on the feeds they are given). Farmers should be careful NOT to feed fish 2 days before harvest, transportation, sampling or when treatment chemicals have been applied in the pond.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGcAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storing fish feeds","id":"a0r70000000StJSAA0","content":"Fish feeds should be stored in a cool, dry place that is well ventilated (has enough air moving around inside it) to maintain its quality so that it can be liked and eaten by the fish.

Signs of the disease include infected cabbage heads becoming soft  watery and at times rotting completely. The affected area on cabbages become soft  mushy and generally turn dark in colour. First signs of bacterial soft rot are an initial infection on the outer leafstalks of cabbages which are in contact with the soil  and the infection spreads to the cabbage heads. Soft rot infection in cabbages almost always emits a bad smell and eventually cabbage leaves  sterns and roots are entirely decayed. Farmers should avoid using contaminated knives when harvesting cabbages since this may make cabbages rot quickly when they are stored. Bacterial soft rot can be controlled by planting cabbages on ridges or raised beds to prevent water logging around the plants  preventing other cabbage diseases such as black rot and damping off since they may provide opportunities for bacterial soft rot to develop. Farmers should harvest healthy cabbage heads first and store them in a cool  dry  airy place  wash hands and harvesting knives  remove and destroy diseased cabbages or left over stems in the field after harvesting.

With good management Friesian can produce above 20 liters per day, jersey above 15 liters per day and Guernsey above 20 liters per day while the local breeds can produce between 2 and 4 liters per day.  Exotic breed have a good performance but may not survive well in our local conditions  because they are easily attacked by diseases spread by ticks (especially if they are not well cared for) and they require very good management which most local farmers may not afford. Breed improvement is done by crossing exotic breeds with the local breeds to come up with breeds that are well adapted to local conditions and can produce larger amounts of milk compared to local breeds.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Structures that a cattle house should have","id":"a0r70000000StNSAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing for calves","id":"a0r70000000StNTAA0","content":"Calves must be kept in a comfortable place and protected from environmental stresses (like too much wind and rain) if they are to grow into quality animals to replace old ones. Calves may grow slowly or even die (especially the weaker ones) if they are exposed to cold, wet or windy conditions. Calves and 1 year old heifers (young cows that have not yet produced calves) that are kept in a good shelter (with a good dry area on which the animals can lie) will grow more quickly in cold conditions compared to those that are not kept in a shelter. The calf shed should be constructed ona dry surface and if possible with a concrete floor (farmers that cannot afford a concrete floor should compress the ground and make sure it is very hard and dry). Calf shelters do not need to be expensive structures but they should be built in ways that allow for easy cleaning and maintenance of hygienic conditions. Cattle shelters should be at least twice as deep as they are wide or high to prevent too much wind from entering even if the front is left open. Cattle shelters should also be wellventilated and positioned in such a way that they get enough sunlight but keep out rain and too much wind (shelters should have at least half of their walls solid to protect the calf from excessive wind while providing enough ventilation). Calves should get enough sunlight because it helps them warm themselves, disinfects bedding and stimulates production of vitamin D which helps calves use well the milk they take. The shelter is considered adequate if it is comfortable for a person to sit dressed only in light clothing. When building cattle shelters, focus should be put on protecting calves from extreme weather and not normal weather conditions because the hair on calves' skins is enough to provide protection from normal weather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Different houses for cows of different ages","id":"a0r70000000StNUAA0","content":"It is a good practice to keep young cows in separate shelters according to their age and the condition in which they are (whether they are pregnant or sick).
