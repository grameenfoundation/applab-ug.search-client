The demands of a sunflower crop on soil macronutrients are not as great as for maize  wheat or potato. Nitrogen is usually the first limiting factor for yield in sunflower. Medium to high levels of macronutrients are usually required for sunflower growth. Ploughing Stover back into soil will usually avail many of these macronutrients. Sunflower poorly tolerates salt  therefore avoid such areas. Sunflower is tolerant of both low and high temperatures but more tolerant to low temperatures. Sunflower seeds will germinate at temperatures of at least 8 to 10°C and  optimum temperatures for growth are 21 to 25°C  but a wider range of temperatures (18 to 32°C) show little effect on productivity. Extremely high temperatures lower oil percentage  seed fill and germination. Sunflower is not considered highly drought tolerant  but is better than Maize and a few others crops.

Dehorning can be done by smearing a chemical (caustic paste or stick) on the horn as it emerges; a clipper or a saw can also be used to dehorn cattle (if the horn is already old and hard).

Important records to keep in a dairy farm include; cow identification number, date of birth, birth weight, age when calf stopped taking milk, reproductive status (pregnant, milking, etc), date when the cow last gave birth, date of service (mating), amount of milk that the cow produces daily, date when a pregnant cow is expected to give birth, health status (if the animal is suffering from any disease and treatment given).

It should be done by an experienced person under clean conditions to avoid spreading diseases to the cow.

will go on heat within every 18 to 24 days. Heat period usually lasts between 6 and 30 hours. The effective heat period within which a cow will get pregnant lasts for 12 to 24 hours from the start of the signs of heat. Cows on heat will be restless, will become noisy, produce less milk and they may stop eating. Other signs of heat include a cow mounting others, standing still when mounted or approached from behind, the cow's vulva swelling, becoming red and a thin clear discharge which is like mucus coming out of the cow's vulva; the cow will also keep raising its tail.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Dairy breeds","id":"a0r70000000StNRAA0","content":"Dairy breed in Uganda are categorized into local and exotic breeds. Local breed include Ankole, small East African Zebu and Nganda. The exotic breeds include Friesian, jersey and Guernsey. Exotic breeds produce more milk than local breeds. With good management Friesian can produce above 20 liters per day, jersey above 15 liters per day and Guernsey above 20 liters per day while the local breeds can produce between 2 and 4 liters per day.  Exotic breed have a good performance but may not survive well in our local conditions  because they are easily attacked by diseases spread by ticks (especially if they are not well cared for) and they require very good management which most local farmers may not afford. Breed improvement is done by crossing exotic breeds with the local breeds to come up with breeds that are well adapted to local conditions and can produce larger amounts of milk compared to local breeds.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Structures that a cattle house should have","id":"a0r70000000StNSAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing for calves","id":"a0r70000000StNTAA0","content":"Calves must be kept in a comfortable place and protected from environmental stresses (like too much wind and rain) if they are to grow into quality animals to replace old ones. Calves may grow slowly or even die (especially the weaker ones) if they are exposed to cold, wet or windy conditions. Calves and 1 year old heifers (young cows that have not yet produced calves) that are kept in a good shelter (with a good dry area on which the animals can lie) will grow more quickly in cold conditions compared to those that are not kept in a shelter. The calf shed should be constructed on a dry surface and if possible with a concrete floor (farmers that cannot afford a concrete floor should compress the ground and make sure it is very hard and dry). Calf shelters do not need to be expensive structures but they should be built in ways that allow for easy cleaning and maintenance of hygienic conditions. Cattle shelters should be at least twice as deep as they are wide or high to prevent too much wind from entering even if the front is left open. Cattle shelters should also be well ventilated and positioned in such a way that they get enough sunlight but keep out rain and too much wind (shelters should have at least half of their walls solid to protect the calf from excessive wind while providing enough ventilation). Calves should get enough sunlight because it helps them warm themselves, disinfects bedding and stimulates production of vitamin D which helps calves use well the milk they take. The shelter is considered adequate if it is comfortable for a person to sit dressed only in light clothing. When building cattle shelters, focus should be put on protecting calves from extreme weather and not normal weather conditions because the hair on calves' skins is enough to provide protection from normal weather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Different houses for cows of different ages","id":"a0r70000000StNUAA0","content":"It is a good practice to keep young cows in separate shelters according to their age and the condition in which they are (whether they are pregnant or sick).

Animals between 5 and 22 months of age (this includes calves, yearlings (1 year old) and weaned heifers) should be kept in a separate shelter.

The structure should provide cattle with enough space, comfort and air should move freely inside. For cattle kept under structures that have a roof, farmers should provide at least 12 square metres for a mature bull, 4 square metres for a cow and 12 square metres for a cow that is about to give birth. For cattle kept in structures without a roof, farmers should increase space and make it double the size of that which is provided for cattle kept in a structure that has a roof. Poorly designed housing can make management of cattle hard, makes it easy for certain diseases to attack cattle and the animals may also injure themselves. The floor of the cattle house should easy to clean and should be slanting towards a manure pit so that urine and water can easily flow away; concrete floors are easy to clean and are more durable. A good structure should be built with its short sides facing the direction of the sun to ensure that they provide enough shade. A shade should be provided over the area where cows rest and feed from; drinking troughs should also be in a shade to keep drinking water as cool as possible.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by

From the time it is planted, it produces seed in about two months. The leaves of this Dodo can be eaten as a vegetable and its seed can be used to make many products.

She harvests the seed when the flowers (seed pulps) turn yellowish, places them on a polythene or mat and beats them to remove the seed. She dries the seed under the sun until they are dry. During a hot sunny day, the seeds will dry in one day. She then roasts the seed and after that, the seeds can be eaten or ground into flour which she uses to make soup, cakes or tea. She says eating the products from this seed helps to treat ulcers.\r\nGrain amaranth is called Dodo in Luganda, Runyakitara and Lhukonzo, lengalenga in Kiswahili\n\nAttribution: Provided by Margrete from Kikandwa.

It is important that you use a clean equipment when making this juice and wash them immediately after making the juice. The remains obtained after filtering the juice can be given to goats and pigs or dried and fed to chicken. Doroviko says taking the juice helps to control some diseases like hernia.\n\nAttribution: Provided by Doroviko from Mubende.

External parasites can be flying or crawling insects like biting flies  ticks  lice and mites (mites are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye). Some external parasites spread diseases to cattle while others only cause damage on cattle's skin. Most parasites prefer staying on specific parts of cattle like the ears  neck  elbows  udder  scrotum and around the tail. SYMPTOMS of cattle being disturbed by external parasites include cattle losing weight  skin losing its normal good shiny condition and becoming dull  having scabies and becoming rough as well as developing wounds which may in some cases become infested with maggots especially if flies are on the cattle. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should keep the house where cattle are kept and the grazing area clean by removing all dung and leftover feeds  any cracks in the house where cattle are kept should be repaired immediately they are seen and the cattle house should also be regularly sprayed with the right insecticides and acaricides that can chase away external parasites (farmers should consult veterinary doctors in their area on which pesticides when controlling external parasites). Treatment: If the number of ticks on cattle is small then they can be removed by hand; animals that have external parasites should be separated from the rest of the herd and if cattle are attacked by too many external parasites then farmers should seek help from a veterinary doctor in their area.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Calf pneumonia Calf having mucus discharge from nose high body temperature difficulty in breathing and having a dull or weak appearance","id":"a0r70000000StMvAAK","content":"This disease is called disease is called calf pnumonia and is caused by a virus; if the affected calf gets other infections the disease can become worse.

Testing for mastitis: Milk the first drops of milk into a strip cup or on to a clean black surface (like a gum boot or the cover of a bucket) and spread the milk by bending the item into which you have put the drops of milk. Look at the milk closely and try to see if it has any colour changes  clots or is watery since all these are signs of mastitis. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Places in which cows are milked should be kept clean  milking should be done gently and teats should not be pulled roughly  if milking machines are used then they should be used correctly to avoid injuring cows teats  cow teats should be dipped in disinfectant solution after milking is done or dry cow therapy should be used (an antibiotic put into the teat of the cow when milking is stopped; farmers should seek advice from veterinary personnel on how to do this). Farmers should carry out a mastitis test daily; cows that have the disease should be milked last and milk got from them should be thrown away.

Before milking starts, the cow's udder and teats should be washed with warm water and dried with a clean cloth; the milker should also first massage the udder to encourage the  milk to flow. Milkers must remember to first wash and dry their hands before they start milking. At every milking, the first milk drops from each teat should be used to test for mastitis and cows found to have mastitis should be milked last. Milking should be done fast but gently and should be completed between 7 and 10 minutes. After milking, the teats should be dipped in a sanitizing solution (ask your veterinary doctor or at a farmer supply shop about the best to use) to remove any particles of milk and kill any bacteria on the teat. The cows should be offered with feeds after milking so that they can remain standing for at least 15 minutes to allow the teat canal to close before the cows lay down (this can help prevent mastitis). Milkers should wash their hands before milking each cow to avoid transmitting diseases from one cow to another. The milk collected should be sieved using a clean white cloth and then it should be measured and recorded so that each cow's level of milk production can be followed. Dairy farmers should make sure that milk is stored away from strong smelling things (like garlic, paraffin, paint) as well as poisonous chemicals or equipment used to apply chemicals. Milk should also be protected from direct sunlight as well as sources of heat. Milk should be taken to a collection centre or the market within 2 hours after milking.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Methods of milking","id":"a0r70000000StNBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General tips","id":"a0r70000000StNCAA0","content":"Milking is one of the most important activities carried out on a dairy farm. Milking should be done atleast 2 times a day; the time at which cows are milked should be maintained (frequently changing milking time should be avoided and it may lead to mastitis). The same person should do the milking regularly; try maintaining the same milker (the milker should be clean and milkers who are ill or who have poor hygiene habits like spitting or blowing noses when milking should not be used). Any changes that are to be introduced in how milking is done should be introduced slowly with time. Before milking  the udder and teats should be cleaned with slightly warm water  an antiseptic (like potassium permanganate solution) and dried with a clean cloth. The cow being milked should be in a comfortable position because animals that are comfortable produce more milk. When milking  each cow should be milked between 5 and 7 minutes. Milking pails in which milk is put should be clean (farmers should try buying milking pails that have a dome shaped top instead of using ordinary buckets or vessels). All milk should be completely milked out of the cow because leaving some milk in the udder can encourage occurance of diseases like mastitis. Cows that are suspected to be sick should be milked last to prevent spreading of diseases. If farmers want good quality milk then they should keep the areas where cows are kept clean and the cows should also be kept in a healthy condition.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storing feeds","id":"a0r70000000StNDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Processing feeds","id":"a0r70000000StNEAA0","content":"Processing involves making changes to pasture, fodder or any other type of cattle food so that it can be stored for a longer time and to make easier for the cattle to digest as well as gain the desired nutrients from it. Processing cattle feeds involves cutting long pastures such as rice, maize, sorghum millet straw and elephant grass into small pieces as well as grinding grain feed (like maize, sorghum and soybean). Processing may also involve adding some things like salt, molasses or urea in the cattle feeds (urea SHOULD NOT be added to feeds for calves that are below 6 months old). When cutting pastures into small pieces farmers can use knives or machetes. NOTE: Processing cattle feeds has costs in terms of both time and money; farmers must carefully look at how they benefit from carrying it out and compare to the costs (money and time) involved before deciding to do it.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding dairy cattle during dry seasons","id":"a0r70000000StNFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding cows that are producing milk","id":"a0r70000000StNGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to feed young female cows that are above 6 months","id":"a0r70000000StNHAA0","content":"Heifers are young cows (especially those that have not yet given birth to a calf).

From 3 to 6 months heifers should be fed on good quality fodder and it is best to give the calf as much as it can eat; heifers at this stage should also be given 1.5 kg of good quality dairy concentrates each day. The amount of concentrates being given to heifers should slowly be reduced so that by 6 months they are being given only 1 kg of concentrates. From 6 to 18 months of age, heifers can be fed on good quality fodder (like dark green napier grass that is 1 metre tall); if the fooder that is available is not of very good quality however farmers can continue feeding the animals with dairy concentrates. Clean water and a mineral lick (this can bebought from farm supply shops) should also be provided for the animals at all times.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to feed calves","id":"a0r70000000StNIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Water for dairy cattle","id":"a0r70000000StNJAA0","content":"Dairy cattle, like all other animals need water for their bodies to function normally; animals can survive longer without food than they can without water.

Dairy farmers should make sure that clean water is available for their animals to drink at all times. It should also be noted that animals that are not given enough water will easily be attacked by diseases and will take long to recover when they are being treated.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuHlAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"MobileMoney Agents","id":"a0r70000000SuHqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:17\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw1uAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Purchase For Progress","id":"a0r70000000SsUaAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw1uAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Transporter Directory","id":"a0r70000000SsUcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw1uAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buyers Directory","id":"a0r70000000SsUdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":null,"menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"CKW Help","id":"a0r70000000SsrkAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 14:46:44\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kiruhura","id":"a0r70000000Stt7AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luwero","id":"a0r70000000Stt8AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Stt9AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Hoima","id":"a0r70000000SttAAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsdAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Maracha","id":"a0r70000000SttBAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StscAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tororo","id":"a0r70000000SttCAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mubende","id":"a0r70000000SttDAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mityana","id":"a0r70000000SttEAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masaka","id":"a0r70000000SttFAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Lwengo","id":"a0r70000000SttGAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kayunga","id":"a0r70000000SttHAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Jinja","id":"a0r70000000SttIAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Products","id":"a0r70000000StG5AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing","id":"a0r70000000StG6AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StG7AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StG8AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of pigs","id":"a0r70000000StG9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SttvAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Animal drugs","id":"a0r70000000Stx9AAC","content":"Coffee Clinic Farm Tools.

Fish farming requires some money to start and needs to be carried out on land which has a nearby source of water that flows throughout the year. The money is used to buy equipment like hoes, pick axes and spades to construct the pond, pay labour for construction of the pond, buy fingerlings (young fish) and feeds for fish. Before starting a fish farm, farmers should first find out if there is market for fish, which type of fish the available customers want and how much they can buy; all this will help farmers avoid losses due to lack of market and low market prices. Carrying out fish farming in an area where people's culture and customs do not allow them to eat fish is very likely to lead to losses for a fish farmer. The fish farmer should draw a plan of how the farm will be managed, inputs needed, costs of buying these inputs, expected number of fish per year as well as expected profits. Farmers who have never done fish farming should start with a small pond to help them get experience before they can put a lot of money in the business.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StGhAAK","content":"Fish is a source of proteins and is liked by very many people. Most people who do not eat meat due to health problems atleast eat fish and this has increased market for fish. Fish farming refers to raising and keeping of fish in ponds or tanks for commercial purposes. Fish farming requires little land since a large number of fish can be kept in a small pond compared to the land needed for keeping other animals like goats and cows. Fish farming also enables farmers to use wetlands that may not be used for growing of crops and rearing of animals. Fish can be fed on waste from the kitchen, animal feed leftovers and as well as manure which ensures that farmers can get income from these wastes. Currently, fish in Uganda is mainly obtained from lakes and rivers and the number of fish in these rivers and lakes is declining rapidly due to use of poor fishing methods (small sized nets). Reduction of fish got from lakes and rivers gives an opportunity for farmers that invest in fish farming to get a good income. Fish has ready market both in rural and urban areas and the farmer can harvest a few fish each day depending on the number of people willing to buy. This avoids wastage due to lack of market. Farmers need to get skills and advice on how best to carry out fish farming before they start investing their money in it.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Local cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Exotic cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowish-white diarrhoea shedding of feathers high death rate","id":"a0r70000000StKpAAK","content":"This is Fowl typhoid disease.

The reasons for castration include making the pigs docile for easy handling or to remove the male smell from their meat. Farmers should castrate piglets early before they are 3 weeks old because at that age they are small and easy to hold, they recover faster with little effect on their growth and they have good protection from infection given by milk they are suckling from their mothers. When carrying out castration, farmers should hold piglets by their hind legs and clean the area around the scrotum with a detergent or any disinfectant. The farmer should firmly hold the testicles, push them outwards till the skin of the scrotum is tight against them then a cut should be made down the length of each testicle. Care should be taken to only cut through the skin and not the testicles; the cut must be at the lower end of the scrotum to allow easy drainage of the blood. The farmer should then pull both testicles through the opening, twist the cord attached to one of the testicles and scrape (drag or pull) the knife across the cord until it breaks; the same should be done for the other testicle.

Another way of supplying iron to piglets is placing clods of red soil in the pen in which the piglets are since eating such soil gives iron to piglets (farmers should get clean soil from areas where no people or animals have stepped (like anthills) to protect piglets from worms).

Some female pigs especially the young ones can injure or kill their piglets when they are giving birth (by lying on them) so farmers should remove piglets until the process of giving birth has ended and they can be returned after the mother has settled down. Piglets may be born when they are all covered in membranes which may prevent them from breathing; if breathing does not start the farmer should clear the membranes away, massage the chest area, hold the piglets by the legs and swing them gently since this helps them to start breathing. If some piglets are too weak to suckle or fail to locate a teat the farmer should guide them to a teat.

Eggs should be stored with the broad end facing upwards (broad end has an air sac through which the egg breathes). To prevent rotting, eggs should be stored in a clean and dry place. Since fertilized eggs get spoilt fast, eggs that have spent more than 10 days should not be given to the hen to incubate/sleep on them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Institute of Development Strategies\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Getting parent stock","id":"a0r70000000StL4AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management systems","id":"a0r70000000StL5AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHnAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Hay or feed store","id":"a0r70000000StLMAA0","content":"Store fodder  for use during the dry season  in stores/barns built adjacent to the goat house that is roofed and has a wooden floor to allow air to pass underneath.

The parasites attack the inside of the ear and cause swelling and a lot of irritation. The affected rabbit will become restless and shakes its head from side to side. The rabbit may also damage its ears from banging them against the side of the cage or house in which rabbits are kept. This can lead to small swellings appearing under the skin on the inside part of the affected ear. When the ear is touched it is hot and the rabbit will appear to be in pain. With time  the swellings (which can become big) will become very hard. Prevention and treatment:  It is important to clear mites from rabbits since they can move from one animal to another. Ears of all the rabbits kept should be checked regularly. Remove the crusts  scales with the help of cotton wool and then apply ear canker preparation (it is readily available in veterinary outlets) or ear drops. Until the mites are removed the rabbit will continue shaking its head. A farmer can test if there are mites in a rabbits ear by gently inserting a cotton bud into the ear and wiping it around. If there are mites they will be stuck to the cotton bud with a brown substance. The mites look like very small fleas; they cause alot of trouble to the rabbit if they are not controlled. Farmers can also dust the rabbits with recommended chemicals or use diatomite powder if it is available. If you keep the rabbit houses clean and dry then the problem of mites is not likely to occur.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Egg production","id":"a0r70000000StLvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StLwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StLxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of chicken layers","id":"a0r70000000StLyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StLzAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing chicken houses","id":"a0r70000000StM0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJ0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to collect and store propolis","id":"a0r70000000StM1AAK","content":"When harvesting propolis a knife or hive tool should be used to collect the smears and lumps of propolis from parts of the hive but care should be taken not to remove paint from the hive and also not to damage the wood from which the hive is made.

Bees usually carry waste out of and away from the hive but if a small lizard or mouse finds its way into the hive and dies there, bees may be unable to carry it out through the hive entrance and in such a case bees cover it in propolis to prevent it from rotting and creating bad smells inside the hive. Beekeepers can make bees produce more propolis by making spaces found inside the hive bigger.

A cow on heat will also produce less milk than it usually produces. At milking time, cows should be observed for atleast 10 minutes about 3 times each day; early morning and late afternoon are the best times to look out for signs of heat in cows since at these times cows are calm (heat may occur during the night so observation in the early morning and late evening is very important).

Know the type and variety of seeds recommended in your area. Such varieties should have the recommendation from the Ministry of Agriculture  NARO  NAADS or extension workers.  2. Note all the quality characteristics and standards on the label and be sure they are what you require. Read all promotional posters. Ask for advice on how and when to plant those seeds.  3. Check the seed packages carefully. All certified seed has been inspected during production by Ministry of Agriculture  and will have an identification label attached to the seed package. It has been tested to make sure it is pure and will germinate.  4. Look around the store to ensure that the seed has been kept properly and protected from rain and excessive heat. Check the package carefully for any signs of damage or insect infestation.  5. Look at the date when the seed was produced. Dont buy seed that is more than one year old or has passed the listed expiry date.  6. Always KEEP your seed package and RECEIPT so that you can complain if there is a problem.  7. Buy early so you can test the germinationn before you plant your entire field.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by UNADA\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsfAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General info","id":"a0r70000000StssAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsgAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Overview","id":"a0r70000000StstAAC","content":"All plants need food (nutrients) for them to grow properly.

Coffee berry disease does not kill coffee trees but it greatly reduces yield which farmers would have got from their coffee crops. Signs of the disease include young expanding coffee berries slowly turning black. Small water filled spots appear on the coffee berries and these spots quickly become dark, sunken and as they spread they make coffee berries rot. Coffee berries also often drop from the branch at an early stage of the disease. Lesions may also occur on young berry stalks, causing them to break off the tree before the berries are affected. The disease also affects ripening berries causing a 'brown blight' phase and this phase is characterised by dark, sunken lesions which cover the ripe red berries. The coffee berry disease may also infect flowers under very wet conditions, and causes brown lesions on petals. Farmers can control the disease by removing berries which are affected from coffee trees, pruning coffee trees after harvesting, removing old stems and thinning out branches as well as timely spraying with copper(NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthkAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves and upper side of leaves losing green colour","id":"a0r70000000StpwAAC","content":"This disease is called coffee leaf rust and it affects leaves causing them to drop if the disease is severe. The disease is favoured by wet warm conditions.The first symptom is formation of small pale yellow spots in diameter on the underside of leaves. As the spots expand they become powdery and yellow to orange and the leaves eventually drop off. This can lead to coffee berry loss and reduction in yields and quality. Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. To prevent coffee leaf rust plant improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee. \n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SteDAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making shade trees","id":"a0r70000000StpxAAC","content":"Establishing shade trees in coffee gardens provides good growing conditions for young coffee trees.

Space left between the planting rows should be 2.4m by 2.4m apart to ease other activities which will be done later when caring for coffee and to ensure correct plant population (about 640 coffee trees should be planted per acre). When digging holes farmers should pile top soil on the upper slope and the subsoil on the lower slope in relation to the hole. Holes made for planting should be 60cm by 60cm by 60cm (2ft by 2ft by 2ft) in size for optimum growing conditions and quick establishment of the tender young coffee roots.

If diseases like late blight occur, farmers may harvest irish potatoes before they are fully grown to avoid making a total loss. When harvesting, irish potato plants should be pulled out of the soil using hands if the ground is soft; if the ground is hard, hoes can be used to dig the plant out of the soil but care should be taken not to cut or damage the irish potatoes in the soil.  A good way of protecting irish potatoes from damage as they are being harvested or transported is by cutting the top parts of irish potato plants off about 10 to 14 days before harvesting is done (this helps potatoes to develop a hard skin while they are still in soil). If the harvested potatoes are to be used for planting, farmers should store them in heaps or piles for about 1 to 2 weeks so that their skins can become hard (during this time farmers should identify and remove any rotten or cut potatoes).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StY7AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StY8AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StY9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYAAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Types","id":"a0r70000000StYBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StYCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparation and Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthlAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How and when to plant","id":"a0r70000000Stq4AAC","content":"Farmers should plant and maintain a plant population of 640 coffee trees per acre.

Press lightly near the stem for maximum contact between roots and soil and then water.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rice","id":"a0r70000000SsUxAAK","content":"Grade 1 quality specifications are: Moisture content: 14%; damaged/immature grains: 2.0%; foreign matter (total): 2.0%\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Beans","id":"a0r70000000SsUyAAK","content":"Grade 1 quality specifications are: Moisture content: 14%; foreign matter: 0.5%; defective beans (total): 2.0% [under this, pest damage: 1.0%, broken/split: 2.0%, other defective beans: 1.0%]; bean classes that blend: 0.5%]; bean classes that contrast: 2.5%; other grains: 0.5%\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Maize","id":"a0r70000000SsUzAAK","content":"Grade 1 quality specifications are: Moisture content: 13.5%; foreign matter (total): 0.5% [under this, inorganic matter: 0.25% and filth: 0.1%]; broken grain:  2.0%; defective grain (total): 4.0% [under this, pest damage: 1.0%, rotten and diseased grain: 2.0%, discoloured grain: 0.5%, immature and shrivelled grain: 1.0%]; other grains: 0.5%\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kampala","id":"a0r70000000SsV0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000SsV1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Jinja","id":"a0r70000000SsV2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000SsV3AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsoAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Lumino","id":"a0r70000000SttrAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StspAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Ryeru","id":"a0r70000000SttsAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsqAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kaproron","id":"a0r70000000StttAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsqAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kaptanya","id":"a0r70000000SttuAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsqAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Trading Centre","id":"a0r70000000SttvAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StssAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Best seed practices","id":"a0r70000000SttwAAC","content":"In order to get the best out of your seeds  you must ensure the following:  Seeds to be planted should be properly stored and handled.

Farmers should use sharp equipment when pruning to prevent tearing or damaging bark on the trees. The first pruning is to about 2 metres and can be done from the ground but as the trees grow taller farmers may need to attach poles or handles to pruning saws so that pruning can be done higher (ladders should never be used when pruning high unless if the ground is very flat, even and firm). When pruning bigger branches, farmers should make 2 cuts in the stem and the first cut should be made about 20 cm away from the stem while the second cut is made very close to the stem. The first cut removes weight off the branch so that when the second cut is made the weight does not rip the branch down and cause damage to the stem and tree bark (stem damage from ripping takes a long time to heal, leaves a wound through which diseases can enter the tree and leaves a scar which reduces quality of timber).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to prune","id":"a0r70000000StqKAAS","content":"Farmers should always prune before branches die since pruning after branches are dead makes dead knots form on the tree.

Farmers growing eucalyptus may do the first pruning when the trees are about 1 to 2 years old and pruning height should be 2 metres. Second round of pruning may be done when eucalyptus trees are between 3 to 4 years old and pruning height should be 4 metres. The third round of pruning can be done when eucalyptus trees are between 5 and 6 years old and pruning height is 7 metres (some farmers stop pruning trees at this stage). A fourth round of pruning may be done when the trees are between 7 and 9 years old and pruning height is 10 metres (farmers should note that doing higher pruning is expensive).

Pruning helps remove heavy branches off a tree before they break off and cause damage to the tree. Pruning also helps remove branches before they die and rot which can cause decay in a tree and can lead to tree diseases. Pruning also raises height of tree branches from the ground which reduces risk of a fire moving from the ground to the upper parts of trees. Pruning at the right time throughout the tree's life ensures that a tree only has knots in the centre of the tree (knots are irregular formations in timber which look like scars) since new wood grows over the scar once branches have been removed (pruned). Knots reduce quality of timber because they do not look good, make it hard for carpenters to work with wood and they also reduce strength of timber.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"What is pruning","id":"a0r70000000StqMAAS","content":"Pruning is the physical removal of a tree's lower branches and it is usually done in stages throughout the life of trees growing in a plantation.

The seedlings or trees which are removed during thinning can be used as firewood, poles or can even be sold if farmers are close to markets. When doing thinning for the first time, farmers can remove one whole line of seedlings or trees but the thinning done after the first one should be more selective (farmers should focus on removing the poor quality seedlings or trees) and should leave behind only the best trees.

Important things to look out for when fighting a fire are what the fire is doing, how fast it is moving, how strongly it is burning, what it is burning and where it is going. The best way to put out a fire is to fight ahead of it (clearing or burning vegetation ahead of it so that by the time it reaches there it has nothing to burn and dies out). When the front of the fire is cut off, people fighting the fire can start trying to put it out from the back and sides by removing all vegetation which it may burn and this will help to slowly start making the fire smaller and easier to put out. When fighting a fire it is important to make sure that everyone has somewhere to escape to and when the fire gets too strong they can fall back to a safer area and continue fighting the fire.

The length of the beds depends on the field shape and farmer’s choices. Soil in the seed bed should be dug until it is smooth and fine. The beds are separated by a pathway of 0.5m to enable the farmer to carryout operations like weeding. A shed should be put over the young plants to protect them from heavy rains and too much sunlight. This shed can be built using spear grass or banana leaves. Before sowing or planting, seeds should be treated with fungicide like Metalaxyl or Victory. This helps to prevent ants from carrying away the seeds and helps control damping off disease. Dig lines or channels at a spacing of 0.5m - 0.75m apart and 2-3 inches deep across the beds to plant the seeds. Cover the seeds lightly and water them. Mulch with rice hulls or straw or grass and water regularly. Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 4-5 weeks, when they are about 4-6 inches high. The seedlings in the nursery should be made ready for planting in the field by reducing water and exposing them to sun one week before planting.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Land preparation","id":"a0r70000000StYZAA0","content":"Fields should be dug before, or at the same time the seeds are sown.Allow enough time between digging and transfering the plants from the nursery to the main garden, so as to expose the soil to sunlight and to birds, wasps and what are known as friendly insects, which will feed on pests and help to remove weed seeds. After digging the field, then the beds should be shaped. Where soils have a heavy clay content, or are poorly drained, make mounds or raised beds. The beds should be at least 100 cm (40 inches) wide and 30 - 40 cm (12 - 15 inches) high. Weeds may begin to emerge before one is ready to transplant, in which case a chemical herbicide that does not stay long in the soil like Glyphosate, or hand weeding is recommended; this will provide the cleanest possible field.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IDEA\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Hot water treatment of seed","id":"a0r70000000StYaAAK","content":"Hot water treatment of hot pepper seeds is at a temperature of 500C for a period of 30 minutes.This temperature can be determined locally by dipping your hands in this water.When you dip your hands in it,this water should not burn your hands however it is recommended that you use a thermometer.Place the seeds in a loose cotton bag and dip this bag in the hot water but do not let it touch the bottom of the container that has this hot water.Leave it in the water for 30 minutes then remove the bag and cool it in clean cold water to stop the heating.Spread the seeds on a clean dry paper to cool and dry under a shade.Do not keep treated seeds.Sow them immediately on a well-prepared seed bed.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting materials","id":"a0r70000000StYbAAK","content":"Hot peppers are grown from seed.

Termites destroy maize roots and stem bases making maize crops wilt, dry up and fall. Damage continues even after maize has fallen. If termites are many they can destroy all the maize in the field especially if they attack when maize is still young. Old maize attacked by termites will produce very poor grain quality. To control termites, maize farmers can use chemicals like terminator, pyrinex,  troban,  endo sulfan,  malataf or dusban. When using Dusban (chloryrifos) a farmer should apply by measuring between 200 to 700mls of dursban mixed 20litres of water per termite mound or anthill. Where there are no termite mounds in the garden, 50 gm (about 5table spoons) of Regent 3-g (fipronil) should be mixed with 20 litres of water and applied to all the locations in the field where termites are feeding. The farmer can also use insecticides that are absorbed by maize (like imidacloprid) to fight termite attacks. Other ways to control termites include ploughing field to destroy the termite nests and channels so that the termites are exposed to ants birds chicken which feed on them. Practicing crop rotation with legumes like beans can also help in reducing termites. Farmers should remove plant remains especially wet and rotting woods. Maize should also be harvested at the right time as termites often attack maize left in the field after they have matured\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-11 12:39:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Holes on maize grain and a lot of grain dust in stored maize","id":"a0r70000000StnUAAS","content":"They can make holes and live in wood and maize.

Signs of large grain borers include holes on maize grains and grain dust in stored maize. Damage is caused by both adults and young large grain borers. Maize grain attacked by large grain borers loses weight reduces in quality due to presence of droppings, shells and insect parts in the maize grain. Maize seeds attacked by large grain borers may also not germinate when planted because the borer destroys the growing points of the maize. To control large grain borers  farmers should harvest maize quickly when it is ready for harvest  store maize in a clean store and in clean containers or sacks and if possible sell the maize stock in the first 3 months after harvest since the extent of large brain borer infestation during the first 3 months of storage is generally low. Mixing diatomite powder with grain before storing in bags or dusting newly harvested dry cobs before storing them with diatomite also helps fight large grain borers (use 1 kg of Diatomite per bag of maize or grain). Also farmers are advised to use fumigants (pesticides that produce gases) like Quick phos (Aluminium phosphide). For bulk grain loosely heaped on wooden platforms apply 2 to 5tablets per ton, this done by putting the tablets on a plate and pushing the plate under the heaped maize grains and covering tightly with a tarpaulin for one day.

They are small insects which usually attack maize when it becomes mouldy since it then contains fungi which the mites feed on. They attack both young maize seedlings as well as fully grown maize. Mites may also attack maize which has been already attacked by other insect pests since mites feed on those other insects which are already living in the maize. Signs of mites include small yellow spots on lower leaves and lower leaves of attacked maize becoming dry (after that the upper leaves on the maize becoming dry too).  Maize which has been attacked by mites gets contaminated and has a bad taste. To control mites farmers should keep maize well in a dry place and prevent it from getting moulds.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rats","id":"a0r70000000StnXAAS","content":"Rats attack maize both in the field and store.They dig out and feed on maize seed from the ground and destroy seedlings as they struggle to feed on remains of the endosperm after germination which reduces maize in the garden. Rats also feed on maize cobs which reduces yield and reduces grain quality.To control the effect of rats farmers should plant 3 to 4 plants per hill and reduce them to 2 seedlings in the third week especially in areas of the garden which have many rats (like near bushes). Doing this will help avoid getting a huge reduction in the number of maize crops when rats attack. Signs of rats in maize include seeing rats in or near maize gardens and some of the planted seeds not germinating (coming out of the ground). To control rats in maize, farmers should maintain clean surroundings by weeding or slashing bushes and clearing garbage since rats usually invade maize fields from nearby bushes and garbage but may fear to cross open ground.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StVoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Plant management","id":"a0r70000000StVpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StVqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StVrAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Arabica","id":"a0r70000000StVsAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StVtAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StVuAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StVvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StVxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StVyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StVzAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StW0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Manangement","id":"a0r70000000StW1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StW2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Where to get improved seeds","id":"a0r70000000StW3AAK","content":"You can search through the Farm Inputs section of CKW Search to get contacts of suppliers from whom you can buy good bean seeds.\n\nBreeder seeds can also be got from the National Crops Resources research Institute at Namulonge.\n\nImproved seeds can also be got  from Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institutes (ZARDI's)  seed companies and stockists across Uganda like FICA  Victoria,  Harvest Farm Seeds  Farmer groups in Wakiso,  Mpigi,  Mbarara,  Kabaale,  Kisoro,  Masindi,  Apac,  Mubende,  Bushyenyi,  Sironko,  Kamwenge and Kabarole. \n\n\nFor more information on improved bean seed types contact National Agricultural Research Organisation(NARO)  National Crops Resesources Research Institute_Namulonge.

If the soil has dried  it will be necessary to use either a spade or similar tool to loosen the soil and harvest the roots. Carrots are usually ready for harvesting 60-85 days after sowing. Mature roots should be orange-colored internally down to the blunt tip. A good market price can be fetched from young carrots with a fresh top  but leaving the top on dries out the root quickly and reduces the marketing period of the crop. An alternative is to cut the top back to about 2 cm and package attractively. For mature carrots the tops are cut down completely to avoid storage rots before marketing. Carrots should be stored separately from other vegetables to prevent a bitter flavor induced by ethylene (a colorless gas with a sweet odor that is produced by many fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening process). Generally carrots store better when they are mature and harvested under moist conditions  and undamaged and free of diseases and pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Biovision and NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StWEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StWFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StWGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWHAA0","content":"Cabbage is often hand-harvested when heads are firm to the touch but before cracking begins. With hand harvesting  a given field is harvested two to four times to obtain heads of uniform size and maturity. Yields will vary with the season of production  cultivar  and production system used. With proper management  cabbage can produce 10-12 tons per acre. Generally  most fresh markets prefer heads that weigh on average between 1 and 2 kg. Farmers should keep their gardens clean by removing crop residues from the garden immediately after harvest.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Arabica","id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Robusta","id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWLAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting and Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StWMAA0","content":"Passion fruits will take 5-7 months to flower.

At times green pods are picked over a long period in home gardens or hedge crops. When growing pigeon peas farmers usually practice ratoon cropping (harvesting pods in one season and leaving pigeon pea plants to produce new pods in the next season). After harvest the stems are cut back to enable the plants to grow again and a second crop is harvested in the following season. After harvesting, farmers can spread out whole pigeon pea plants or pods to dry in the air after which they are threshed (using hands or cattle) and the seeds are cleaned. Clean pigeon peas prevent insect attack which can lead to alot of damage in the harvested crop. Farmers can also store pigeon peas as split peas (removed from pods) to reduce attacks from small beetles which are called bruchids.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWWAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWXAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWYAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWZAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Commercial varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWaAAK","content":"There are; Sunfola (black seeded  thin seed coat  medium stature  early maturing  40% oil content and up to 1800kg/ha yield)   S400  S430  and SH 3422 whose average seed yields are 1300- 2000 kg/ha and with an oil content of 50%.

Use certified seeds and should be dressed with a broad spectrum fungicide such as captan or thiran for protection against soil borne pathogens.  After planting  cover them with a screen  as the birds and animals love to dig the seeds out. You can also start them in a seedbed (free of weeds) and with fine non compacted soil with organic matter. Transfer seedlings when they are small. Clear the main garden free of trees  shrubs and weeds. No shading is required. Till the land thoroughly  to a fine non compacted soil. A second ploughing is necessary if planting is on virgin land. Otherwise a single ploughing is sufficient on already cultivatable land. The crop is line planted (as opposed to broadcast) at a spacing of 2.5 X 1.7ft and 2 seeds per hole. An application of P205 fertilizer before planting and 60kg/ha of Nitrogen at thinning are recommended. Thinning can be done to leave only one or two plants to a hill resulting in an approximate plant population of 55 000 plants/ha. Lower plant populations are recommended in areas where rainfall is limited (on average 33 000-45 000 plants per acre in semi-arid areas). This compares with a recommendation for 45 000-60 000 plants/ha in areas where there is more moisture. Sunflower always point their blooms to the rising sun in the East. Keep this in mind as you determine where to plant them. A planting depth of 1 to 3.5 in. allows sunflower seeds to reach available moisture and gives satisfactory stands. Deeper plantings result in reduced stands and yields. Sowing can be done by corn planter in the furrows and after 10-12 days of germination.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWeAAK","content":"Yield will largely depend on the number of heads per hectare. Plant population is therefore the major determinant of yield. When all other factors are constant  low populations will result in heavier but more seeds per head and the reverse is true. Additionally yield varies with variety  weather  soil conditions and pests and diseases. After flower formation (budding)  sunflower will be ready for harvesting after about 30 to 40 days or more. At this stage  ready plants for harvesting will have the back of the head turned from green to yellow and the bracts have changed to brown. To harvest  cut the stems using a Panga at about 3ft above ground and the heads spiked face down on them and left to dry. Do not delay to harvest as seeds become too dry and shell out leading to field losses. It is better to harvest at 14-15% moisture. The dried heads are then threshed by beating them with sticks on clean materials. A maize Sheller can also be used. Plantation farmers can use any suitably modified combines. Dry to a moisture content of about 14% before storage.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nutritional Value Per 100g","id":"a0r70000000StWfAAK","content":"Energy 2 385 kJ (570 kcal)  Carbohydrates 18.76g  Sugars 2.62g  Dietary fiber 10.5g  Fat 49.57g  saturated 5.20g  monounsaturated 9.46g  polyunsaturated 32.74g  Protein 22.78g  Thiamine (Vit.

If birds are not a problem then wheat plants can be stacked or spread out to dry in the sun in a clean area preferably on a cement slab or plastic sheet in order to reduce losses. Threshing is done by beating with flails  humans or animals stepping on the straw with their feet  or by driving a small tractor over the straw.

Branches and top parts of the coffee tree which has been attacked break off easily but the main tree usually survives. Leaves on affected coffee trees may also start becoming yellow, drying up and may eventually die. Another sign is bits of eaten wood being pushed out of the tunnels which stem borers make in the coffee stems. Farmers should inspect their robusta coffee gardens regularly to identify infected trees. Ways of controlling stem borers include mantaining a good shade for coffee trees, cutting and burning coffee trees which are heavily infected and have coffee borers inside them. Another way of controlling stem borers is to kill them by inserting a strong wire into the holes made by borers. Farmers can also soak cotton wool in neem oil solution and insert it into bored holes to kill stem borers.

Mealy bugs cause a sooty mould on leaves and around coffee berries. These pests attack growing tips of robusta coffee trees and can cause serious damage in dry seasons when water is lacking. Mealy bugs may also attack coffee which has been sprayed with insecticide sprays. Farmers can control mealy bugs by spraying coffee trees with neem extract (this is made by collecting one kg of  neem leaves, pound the leaves, add 10 litres of water and stir thoroughly every 10 minutes for 1 hour. Farmers should then sieve or strain out the liquid add a matchbox size of soap to the liquid and spray affected coffee).

Other ways to control coffee berry borers is by pruning fields regularly to reduce shade, picking ripe berries regularly (atleast once every 14 days) and spreading tarpaulin or sacks below coffee trees when harvesting to prevent infected berries from falling into the mulch (since this may spread the pests). Farmers should also not allow coffee berries and bags from infested farms to be transported to other farms since this may spread the pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small slightly raised spots on both green and ripening","id":"a0r70000000StoKAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves upper side of leaves losing green colour and leaves falling off trees","id":"a0r70000000StoLAAS","content":"This is coffee leaf rust disease and it is favoured by wet, warm weather.

The coffee tree may also start producing very small coffee berries which turn black before they are ripe. Coffee leaf rust disease also causes leaves to drop and if this happens alot the entire coffee tree can die as well as lose coffee berries. Another sign of coffee leaf rust disease is very small coffee berries which turn black before they are fully ripe. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee. Farmers can control coffee leaf rust disease by planting resistant types of robusta coffee, ensuring that coffee trees get the nutrients they require and maintaining average shade in the coffee garden.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Coffee trees produce less coffee leaves turn yellow drying up and death of leaves and whole tree rottin into a wet white mass with black lines","id":"a0r70000000StoMAAS","content":"This disease is called root or collar rot and it is transmitted when roots of healthy coffee come into contact with tree roots which have the disease.

Roots of affected robusta coffee trees will have a white coating and when the disease is advanced the wood on coffee trees will rot into a white wet mass with black lines running through the tissue. Vertical cracks may also occur at the base of the coffee tree stem. Farmers can control collar rot by ring barking trees before they are cut down (this prevents the fungus which causes collar rot from getting nutrients which enable it to survive in old tree stumps).

After flowering, most bananas take between 3 and 4 months to mature. Bunches are harvested by cutting them away from the plant just above where the fruit begins. The stem is cut-off with a clean cut at ground level after harvesting the bunch (the stem and other parts of the banana plant that are cut off can be cut into small pieces and used during mulching). It is very important that bunches do not fall or bump during transport, as this causes them to blacken and rot. To avoid damaging the bunches during harvesting at least 2 people should be involved in harvesting (especially for heavy bunches or banana types that have tall trees); one person does the cutting while the other one supports the bunch so that it does not fall to the ground. An experienced worker, however, can harvest alone.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StX9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXAAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StXBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop Management","id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXHAA0","content":"Onions should not be planted in a field in which plants that are in the onion family (like garlic) have been grown in the previous season; this prevents pests and diseases from being carried over to the new onions being planted.

Prevention and control: Farmers should make sure their coffee crops are getting enough shade and they should manage their coffee trees well by controlling weeds, mulching coffee fields, watering the trees, controlling pests and diseases immediately they are seen, making sure that fertilizers are used in a balanced way and that the coffee crops get enough nitrogen and potassium.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Café Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-09-10 09:58:55\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsV3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nyakatonzi Cooperative Union Ltd","id":"a0r70000000SsVzAAK","content":"Plot 9-3 Kasese/ Fort Portal Road,Tel:077426883, Email: ngcu@utlonline.co.ug\nThe storage charges are: \n - handling: 6/= per kg at arrival\n - drying and cleaning: 13/= per kg at arrival of 0.5% above target with increments of 3/= for each additional 0.5% moisture content\n - cleaning only: 8/= per kg\n - drying only: 5/= per kg at arrival of 0.5% above target with increments of 3/= for each additional 0.5% moisture content\n - bagging: 17/= per kg of dry clean grain\n - storage of commingled maize and paddy rice: 7.5/= per kg per month, or pro-rata for number of days stored\n - storage of commingled beans: 9/= per kg per month, or pro-rata for number of days stored\n - storage of identity preserved grain: price to be negotiated with customer\n - handling out: 3/= per kg\n - additional fumigation: 3.5/= per kg\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsV8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Depositing","id":"a0r70000000SsW0AAK","content":"To deposit, one must be registered on the Electronic Warehouse Receipt System (eWRS).

Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Prevention and control: Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rust by planting improved coffee seed types which are resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee begins flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).

In order to provide the required cold conditions and water vapour, farmers should place buckets or pots of water in the house where mushrooms are being grown; the mushrooms should also be watered atleast twice a day (in the morning and evening) but farmers that can afford to water more than 2 times should do it. It is best to grow mushrooms in a house that has a grass thatched roof because such houses are cool inside; mushrooms can also be grown in houses that have ironsheet roofs but farmers using such houses should lay out some thatch on the ironsheet roof or make a ceiling in the house to help make it cool inside. The house in which mushrooms are grown should have windows to let in light since it is needed by the mushrooms as they grow; the light inside the house should be enough for someone standing in the centre of the room to read a book.

Other vanilla pests include: Chicken which damage vanilla roots by scratching away the mulched part, exposing the roots and making the plant dry up. Termites are also a major vanilla pest especially in the dry season (termites can kill or stop the support tree from growing normally). There are also black ants that can damage flower buds that have not yet opened which makes flowers drop off before they are pollinated; these black ants also encourage mealy bugs and scale insects to attack vanilla and make flowers drop off before pollination occurs. Thieves can sometimes also steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure that chicken are kept out of vanilla gardens. Black ants can be controlled by applying ash on the soil around the support tree and vanilla vines. Vanilla gardens should be near farmers' homes because this makes it easier to inspect the vanilla everyday and may keep away thieves that steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. Vanilla stores should also be properly contructed to keep out thieves and other pests (any cracks or holes that develop should be closed or repaired quickly).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Disease","id":"a0r70000000StXcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXeAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXfAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXgAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXhAAK","content":"Ginger is ready for harvest in about 9 to 10 months after it is planted. Signs that ginger is mature enough for harvest include yellowing of leaves and stems of ginger plants breaking. Farmers can choose to leave ginger in the soil (for up to 2 years) if there is no market for them; when the rains come this ginger will germinate again and continue growing for another season. In Uganda ginger is harvested using hands (in a way that is similar to how sweet potatoes are harvested ); mature ginger is dug up from the soil using a hoe and then farmers use hands to break it off the main stem. Roots should be removed from harvested ginger, soil should be cleaned off and the ginger should then be washed in water and laid out in a shade to dry (clean ginger will be bought at better prices at the market). Under good growing conditions and when proper spacing is used at planting, farmers may harvest about 10 sacks of hybrid ginger or 5 sacks of local ginger from 1 acre of land.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MUK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000StXkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXmAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXnAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StXoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGjWAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of heat in cattle","id":"a0r70000000TGswAAG","content":"The most important sign for animal ready to mate or be inseminated is that ‘the animal will stands still (in one place) and allows other animals to mount it or when touched at the back, it stands normally with its tail lifted upwards (this is called standing period).
