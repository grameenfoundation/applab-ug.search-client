","id":"a0r70000000StgtAAC","content":"Sunflower responds to Nitrogen  Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and nitrogen is usually the most common limiting factor for yield. However nitrogen fertilizer tends to reduce oil percentage of the seed  change the amino acid balance  and increase leaf area of the plant. Yield increases when up to 80kg/acre of Nitrogen fertilizer are applied. Nitrogen recommendations in dryer regions can be made from estimates of nitrate nitrogen in the soil (contact NARO for soils analysis). In the wetter regions recommendations are based upon soil organic matter and previous crop history  and it is recommended to apply 8kg Nitrogen /acre after fallow  27kg Nitrogen /acre after small grain and 36 to 45kg Nitrogen /acre after corn. On higher organic matter soils  amounts should be lowered. Nitrogen can be supplied from mineral or non-mineral sources (manures and legume stover  compost). Row placement of Phosphorus and potassium may be important in sunflower for maximizing efficiency of fertilizer use  as it is with many species. Recommendations for applications of Phosphorus and potassium should be made from soil tests and the yield goal for each field. Apply extra phosphorus and potassium when the flower bud begins to develop  to promote bigger blooms. Recommendations range from 18 to 32kg/acre P2O5 and 27 to 64kg/acre K2O for soils testing very low in Phosphorus or potassium  depending on soil yield potential. These recommendations decrease as soil test Phosphorus and/or potassium increase. Response to Phosphorus is not expected if soil Phosphorus exceeds 13kg/acre nor to potassium if the potassium tests is greater than 136kg/acre.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWbAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Intercropping","id":"a0r70000000StguAAC","content":"Sunflowercan be grown as a pure stand but can also be intercroped with other anuals especially legumes (Beans  Soya beans).\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWcAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Birds","id":"a0r70000000StgvAAC","content":"One of the most serious constraints to sunflower production in Uganda is birds.

Farmersshould be careful to burn cleared vegetation when conditions are favourable (do not burn on windy days and have enough people with fire fighting equipment ready so that they can put out the incase it becomes uncontrolled.)\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luweero","id":"a0r70000000Su5yAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buikwe","id":"a0r70000000Su5zAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nwoya","id":"a0r70000000Su60AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su61AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su62AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rubirizi","id":"a0r70000000Su63AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mitooma","id":"a0r70000000Su64AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buhweju","id":"a0r70000000Su65AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sheema","id":"a0r70000000Su66AAC","content":"No Content\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pader","id":"a0r70000000Su67AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bushenyi","id":"a0r70000000Su68AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kitgum","id":"a0r70000000Su69AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Agago","id":"a0r70000000Su6AAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mukono","id":"a0r70000000Su6BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nakaseke","id":"a0r70000000Su6CAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su6DAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4RAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Oyam","id":"a0r70000000Su6EAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su6FAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Choosing the right seeds","id":"a0r70000000StlsAAC","content":"You choose the type of seeds to plant by considering the seeds' resistance to diseases and hard weather conditions like drought and heavy rains, how long they take to mature, how much buyers like them, the climate of your area and how much yield the seeds can give.Farmers growing beans to feed the family may prefer bean types that cook faster while a farmer growing beans for sale may plant bean types that are on high demand in the market.

Chalkbrood disease usually cannot kill all bees in a hive but it reduces the strength of the bee colony and reduces the amount of honey produced by bees.  Causes of the disease include hives that are poorly ventilated and have a lot of moisture in them  , very cool temperatures or bees not getting enough food. Signs of chalkbrood include young ones of bees (larvae) becoming chalk white and being covered with cotton like hairs. The white colour of young ones will start changing to gray or black. Infected or dead young ones of bees may be seen at the hive entrance. Prevention and control: Beekeepers should improve ventilation (flow of air) in hives to avoid moisture collecting in the hives; ventilation can be improved by making more holes on the hive. Old black brood combs (where the young ones of bees are kept) should be destroyed because they may be having organisms which cause chalkbrood disease.

The farmer should replace soil in the hole around the rootsmaking sure that the seedling and roots remain in an upright position. The soil which has been placed in the hole should then be firmed with hands (not feet) and this is done by pushing the soil down and in but not with too much force).\nAnother way of planting is called water planting and it involves adding water to the newly planted seedlings. This type of planting gives seedlings an excellent start and leads to very high survival rates but it is expensive and requires alot of work to get water to the planting site to keep up with the planting.

After the 2 weeks dilute the liquid with 300 litres of water and pour half a litre around each plant. Do not pour the manure on the plant.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYNAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site selection","id":"a0r70000000StmHAAS","content":"Cotton grows well in warm areas with enough sunshine.

Tanning skins and manufacturing leather products adds 5 to 10 times value to the skins. In hot humid conditions skin rotting occurs quickly and spoils the skin. \nThe first stage in the preservation of fresh skins is known as curing and there are 2 simple methods of skin curing. \n1.  Air-drying: - The wet skin is either  pegged out on the ground or tied to a frame and dried upright. It is important to avoid any damage to the skin and to try not to spoil the edges through clumsy pegging or tying. In climates that are not too humid  skins can be cured in 1-2 days. \n2. SaltCuring: - The fresh skin is cleaned of any blood or dirt  and washed with clean water. It is laid out with the inside facing upwards. Salt equivalent to 40 % of its weight is sprinkled on to it  until it is covered in an even layer. The salt will serve both to reduce its water content and to prevent bacterial development. The skin can be folded with the salted side inside and kept in this way for long periods before tanning. \n3. The advanced form of skin processing is leather tanning. There are different types of leather that can be produce from goatskins. Vegetable tanned leather: this has the most potential for rural area tanning.

Farmers should also avoid growing crops in the cabbage family in the same field for a period of at least three seasons.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000StfuAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StfvAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StfwAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StfxAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop Management","id":"a0r70000000StfyAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StfzAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000Stg0AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000Stg1AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000Stg2AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000Stg3AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000Stg4AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site selection","id":"a0r70000000StgzAAC","content":"Sunflower is an annual plant  growing to a height of 2.0m (6-7ft) with a growth cycle of five months.

The demands of a sunflower crop on soil macronutrients are not as great as for maize  wheat or potato. Nitrogen is usually the first limiting factor for yield in sunflower. Medium to high levels of macronutrients are usually required for sunflower growth. Ploughing Stover back into soil will usually avail many of these macronutrients. Sunflower poorly tolerates salt  therefore avoid such areas. Sunflower is tolerant of both low and high temperatures but more tolerant to low temperatures. Sunflower seeds will germinate at temperatures of at least 8 to 10C and  optimum temperatures for growth are 21 to 25C  but a wider range of temperatures (18 to 32C) show little effect on productivity. Extremely high temperatures lower oil percentage  seed fill and germination. Sunflower is not considered highly drought tolerant  but is betterthan Maize and a few others crops.

Dehorning can be done by smearing a chemical (caustic paste or stick) on the horn as it emerges; a clipper or a saw can also be used to dehorn cattle (if the horn is already old and hard).

Important records to keep ina dairy farm include; cow identification number, date of birth, birth weight, age when calf stopped taking milk, reproductive status (pregnant, milking, etc), date when the cow last gave birth, date of service (mating), amount of milk that the cow produces daily, date when a pregnant cow is expected to give birth, health status (if the animal is suffering from any disease and treatment given).

It should be done by an experienced person under clean conditions to avoid spreading diseases to the cow.

Exotic breed have a good performance but may not survive well in our local conditions  because they are easily attacked by diseases spread by ticks (especially if they are not well cared for) and they require very good management which most local farmers may not afford.

Calves and 1 year old heifers (young cows that have not yet produced calves) that are kept in a good shelter (with a good dry area on which the animals can lie) will grow more quickly in cold conditions compared to those that are not kept in a shelter. The calf shed should be constructed on a dry surface and if possible with a concrete floor (farmers that cannot afford a concrete floor should compress the ground and make sure it is very hard and dry). Calf shelters do not need to be expensive structures but they should be built in ways that allow for easy cleaning and maintenance of hygienic conditions. Cattle shelters should be at least twice as deep as they are wide or high to prevent too much wind from entering even if thefront is left open. Cattle shelters should also be well ventilated and positioned in such a way that they get enough sunlight but keep out rain and too much wind (shelters should have at least half of their walls solid to protect the calf from excessive wind while providing enough ventilation). Calves should get enough sunlight because it helps them warm themselves, disinfects bedding and stimulates production of vitamin D which helps calves use well the milk they take. The shelter is consideredadequate if it is comfortable for a person to sit dressed only in light clothing. When building cattle shelters, focus should be put on protecting calves from extreme weather and not normal weather conditions because the hair on calves' skins is enough to provide protection from normal weather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Different houses for cows of different ages","id":"a0r70000000StNUAA0","content":"It is a good practice to keep young cows in separate shelters according to their age and the condition in which they are (whether they are pregnant or sick).

He uses different amounts of water depending on the type of pumpkin being processed. If he adds orange juice, he can store the juice for 7 days.

External parasites can be flying or crawling insects like biting flies  ticks  lice and mites (mites are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye). Some external parasites spread diseases to cattle while others only cause damage on cattle's skin. Most parasites prefer staying on specific parts of cattle like the ears  neck  elbows  udder  scrotum and around the tail. SYMPTOMS of cattle being disturbed by external parasites include cattle losing weight  skin losing its normal good shiny condition and becoming dull  having scabies and becoming rough as well as developing wounds which may in some casesbecome infested with maggots especially if flies are on the cattle. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should keep the house where cattle are kept and the grazing area clean by removing all dung and leftover feeds  any cracks in the house where cattle are kept should be repaired immediately they are seen and the cattle house should also be regularly sprayed with the right insecticides and acaricides that can chase away external parasites (farmers should consult veterinary doctors in their area on which pesticides when controlling external parasites). Treatment: If the number of ticks on cattle is small then they can be removed by hand; animals that have external parasites should be separated from the rest of the herd and if cattle are attacked by too many external parasites then farmers should seek help from a veterinary doctor in their area.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Calf pneumonia Calf having mucus discharge from nose high body temperature difficulty in breathing and having a dull or weak appearance","id":"a0r70000000StMvAAK","content":"This disease is called disease is called calf pnumonia and is caused by a virus; if the affected calf gets other infections the disease can become worse.

SYMPTOMS include a mucus discharge from the nose  high body temperature  difficulty breathing and dull or weak appearance. The symptoms will worsen during cold weather. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should maintain a high level of hygiene in the house where calves are being kept  calves of less than 6 months should not be mixed with old cows  the house where calves are kept should be well ventilated and should not be overcrowded.  Treatment: Calves suffering from calf pneumonia can be treated by injecting them with antibiotics (farmers must seek advice from veterinary doctors in their area on which antibiotics to use and how to inject the calves).

SYMPTOMS include the udder swelling and becoming painful (cow kicks when the udder is touched) and hot   milk becomes watery  yellowish and contains clots. The affected area of the udder will also become hard and themilk coming from it will reduce. Milk got from cows suffering from mastitis may have blood stains  affected cows have a high body temperature and the amount of milk they produce will reduce. Farmers should know how to test milk to see if their cows are suffering from mastitis. Testing for mastitis: Milk the first drops of milk into a strip cup or on to a clean black surface (like a gum boot or the cover of a bucket) and spread the milk by bending the item into which you have put the drops of milk. Look at the milk closely and try to see if it has any colour changes  clots or is watery since all these are signs of mastitis. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Places in which cows are milked should be kept clean  milking should be done gently and teats should not be pulled roughly  if milking machines are used then they should be used correctly to avoid injuring cows teats  cow teats should be dipped in disinfectant solution after milking is done or dry cow therapy should be used (an antibiotic putinto the teat of the cow when milking is stopped; farmers should seek advice from veterinary personnel on how to do this). Farmers should carry out a mastitis test daily; cows that have the disease should be milked last and milk got from them should be thrown away. Treatment: Farmers should seek advice from a veterinary doctor on what the best antibiotic to use is when treating mastitis. Milk or meat from cows that were getting treatment should not be consumed until the cows heal.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Anaplasmosis Gums eyes and other body parts becoming yellow high body temperature and difficulty in passing out dung","id":"a0r70000000StMyAAK","content":"This disease is called anaplasmosis and  it is spread by ticks and biting flies such as they suck blood from cattle (especially cross-bred and exotic breeds).

Before milking starts, the cow's udder and teats should be washed with warm water and dried with a clean cloth; the milker should also first massage the udder to encourage the  milk to flow. Milkers must remember to first wash and dry their hands before they start milking. At every milking, the first milk drops from each teat should be used to test for mastitis and cows found to have mastitis should be milked last. Milking should be done fast but gently and should be completed between 7 and 10 minutes. After milking, the teats should be dipped in a sanitizing solution (ask your veterinary doctor or at a farmer supply shop about the best to use) to remove any particles of milk and kill any bacteria on the teat. The cows should be offered with feeds after milking so that they can remain standing for at least 15 minutes to allow the teat canal to close before the cows lay down (this can help prevent mastitis). Milkers should wash their hands before milking each cow to avoid transmitting diseases from one cow to another. The milk collected should be sieved using a clean white cloth and then it should be measured and recorded so that each cow's level of milk production can be followed. Dairy farmers should make sure that milk is stored away from strong smelling things (like garlic, paraffin, paint) as well as poisonouschemicals or equipment used to apply chemicals. Milk should also be protected from direct sunlight as well as sources of heat.

The same person should do the milking regularly; try maintaining the same milker (the milker should be clean and milkers who are ill or who have poor hygiene habits like spitting or blowing noses when milking should not be used). Any changes that are to be introduced in how milking is done should be introduced slowly with time. Before milking  the udder and teats should be cleaned with slightly warm water  an antiseptic (like potassium permanganate solution) and dried with a clean cloth. The cow being milked should be in a comfortable position because animals that are comfortable produce more milk. When milking  each cow should be milked between 5 and 7 minutes. Milking pails in which milk is put should be clean (farmers should try buying milking pails that have a dome shaped top instead of using ordinary buckets or vessels). All milk should be completely milked out of the cow because leaving some milk in the udder can encourage occurance of diseases like mastitis. Cows that are suspected to be sick should be milked last to prevent spreading of diseases. If farmers want good quality milk then they should keep the areas where cows are kept clean and the cows should also be kept in a healthy condition.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storing feeds","id":"a0r70000000StNDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Processing feeds","id":"a0r70000000StNEAA0","content":"Processing involves making changes to pasture, fodder or any other type of cattle food so that it can be stored for a longer time and to make easier for the cattle to digest as well as gain the desired nutrients from it.

It should also be noted that animals that are not given enough water will easily be attacked by diseases and will take long to recover when they are being treated.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuHlAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"MobileMoney Agents","id":"a0r70000000SuHqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:17\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw1uAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Purchase For Progress","id":"a0r70000000SsUaAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-15 09:50:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw1uAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Transporter Directory","id":"a0r70000000SsUcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-15 09:52:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw1uAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buyers Directory","id":"a0r70000000SsUdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-15 09:48:55\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":null,"menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"CKW Help","id":"a0r70000000SsrkAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 14:46:44\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kiruhura","id":"a0r70000000Stt7AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luwero","id":"a0r70000000Stt8AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Stt9AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Hoima","id":"a0r70000000SttAAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsdAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Maracha","id":"a0r70000000SttBAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StscAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tororo","id":"a0r70000000SttCAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mubende","id":"a0r70000000SttDAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mityana","id":"a0r70000000SttEAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masaka","id":"a0r70000000SttFAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Lwengo","id":"a0r70000000SttGAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kayunga","id":"a0r70000000SttHAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Jinja","id":"a0r70000000SttIAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Products","id":"a0r70000000StG5AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing","id":"a0r70000000StG6AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StG7AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StG8AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of pigs","id":"a0r70000000StG9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SttvAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Animal drugs","id":"a0r70000000Stx9AAC","content":"Coffee Clinic Farm Tools.

Fish farming requires some money to start and needs to be carried out on land which has a nearby source of water that flows throughout the year. The money is used to buy equipment like hoes, pick axes and spades to constructthe pond, pay labour for construction of the pond, buy fingerlings (young fish) and feeds for fish. Before starting a fish farm, farmers should first find out if there is market for fish, which type of fish the available customers want and how much they can buy; all this will help farmers avoid losses due to lack of market and low market prices. Carrying out fish farming in an area where people's culture and customs do not allow them to eat fish is very likely to lead to losses for a fish farmer. The fish farmer should draw a plan of how the farm will be managed, inputs needed, costs of buying these inputs, expected number of fish per year as well as expected profits. Farmers who have never done fish farming should start with a small pond to help them get experience before they can put a lot of money in the business.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StGhAAK","content":"Fish is a source of proteins and is liked by very many people. Most people who do not eat meat due to health problems atleast eat fish and this has increased market for fish. Fish farming refers to raising and keeping of fish in ponds or tanks for commercial purposes. Fish farming requires little land since a large number of fish can be kept in a small pond compared to the land needed for keeping other animals like goats and cows. Fish farming also enables farmers to use wetlands that may not be used for growing of crops and rearing of animals. Fish can be fed on waste from the kitchen, animal feed leftovers and as well as manure which ensures that farmers can get income from these wastes. Currently, fish in Uganda is mainly obtained from lakes and rivers and the number of fish in these rivers and lakes is declining rapidly due to use of poor fishing methods (small sized nets). Reduction of fish got from lakes and rivers gives an opportunity for farmers that invest in fish farming to get a good income. Fish has ready market both in rural and urban areas and the farmer can harvest a few fish each day depending on the number of people willing to buy. This avoids wastage due to lack of market. Farmers need to get skills and advice on how best to carry out fish farming before they start investing their money in it.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Local cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Exotic cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Dairy Cow Judgement","id":"a0r70000000StGkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowish-white diarrhoea shedding of feathers high death rate","id":"a0r70000000StKpAAK","content":"This is Fowl typhoid disease.

Piglets which do not haveenough iron will become pale a few weeks after they are born and the rate at which they grow will slow down. Farmers may need to give iron supplements to newly born piglets and ways of doing this include: iron tablets which farmers can buy and crush to make a paste which should then be put in piglets mouths 24 hours after they are born. Another way of supplying iron to piglets is placing clods of red soil in the pen in which the piglets are since eating such soil gives iron to piglets (farmersshould get clean soil from areas where no people or animals have stepped (like anthills) to protect piglets from worms). Farmers can also buy an iron solution and rub it on the sow teats to help piglets get some iron as they suckle. Farmers can also consult a veterinary doctor to give piglets an injection of iron (only experienced and qualified vets should administer the injection).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Caring for the navel cord area","id":"a0r70000000StKJAA0","content":"A few minutes after piglets are born their umbilical cords may be pulled gently away or cut if necessary (to a length of about 1 inch).

However, the farmer is advised to be present and carefully look at how the pig gives birth in case it experiences any problem which might require the farmer to give the pig or the piglets it is producing. Some female pigs especially the young ones can injure or kill their piglets when they are giving birth (by lying on them) so farmers should remove piglets until the process of giving birth has ended and they can be returned after the mother has settled down. Piglets may be born when they are all covered in membranes which may prevent them from breathing; if breathing does not start the farmer should clear the membranes away, massage the chest area, hold the piglets by the legs and swing them gently since this helps them to start breathing. If some piglets are too weak to suckle or fail to locate a teat the farmer should guide them to a teat. If piglets have very long navel chords farmers should shorten them by cutting off a piece, and the end attached to the piglet should be dipped in an iodine solution to prevent infection.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of a pig about to give birth","id":"a0r70000000StKNAA0","content":"When a pregnant pig is about to give birth she becomes restless about 24 hours before she gives birth.

The parasites attack the inside of the ear and cause swelling and a lot of irritation. The affected rabbit will become restless and shakes its head from side to side. The rabbit may also damage its ears from banging them against the side of the cage or house in which rabbits are kept. This can lead to small swellings appearing under the skin on the inside part of the affected ear. When the ear is touched it is hot and the rabbit will appear to be in pain. With time  the swellings (which can become big) will become very hard. Prevention and treatment:  It is important to clear mites from rabbits since they can move from one animal to another. Ears of all the rabbits kept should be checked regularly. Remove thecrusts  scales with the help of cotton wool and then apply ear canker preparation (it is readily available in veterinary outlets) or ear drops. Until the mites are removed the rabbit will continue shaking its head. A farmer can test if there are mites in a rabbits ear by gently inserting a cotton bud into the ear and wiping it around. If there are mites they will be stuck to the cotton bud with a brown substance. The mites look like very small fleas; they cause alot of trouble to the rabbit ifthey are not controlled. Farmers can also dust the rabbits with recommended chemicals or use diatomite powder if it is available. If you keep the rabbit houses clean and dry then the problem of mites is not likely to occur.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Egg production","id":"a0r70000000StLvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-3015:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StLwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StLxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of chicken layers","id":"a0r70000000StLyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StLzAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing chicken houses","id":"a0r70000000StM0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJ0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to collect and store propolis","id":"a0r70000000StM1AAK","content":"When harvesting propolis a knife or hive tool should be used to collect the smears and lumps of propolis from parts of the hive but care should be taken not to remove paint from the hive and also not to damage the wood from which the hive is made.

The bars should be removed one by one until the first bar is reached which will be white and new (it may be empty or may contain some unripened honey so it should be replaced so that bees can develop the comb). Only combs that have fully or partly capped (covered) cells should be removed and a brush or feather should be used to gently sweep any bees on the comb back into the hive. The removed combs should be cut off the top bar (leaving about 2 cm for bees to start building up again); the comb should be placed in a clean container and the top bar should be replaced into the hive. combs that are dark in colour and contain pollen should be left since this is where queen bees lay their eggs.

A cow on heat will also produce less milk than it usually produces. At milking time, cows should be observed for atleast 10 minutes about 3 times each day; early morning and late afternoon are the best times to look out for signs of heat in cows since at these times cows are calm (heat may occur during the night so observation in the early morning and lateevening is very important). It is very important for farmers to feed their cattle well (on high quality grass) because poor feeding can cause heat to last only a few hours and it may pass by without being noticed.

Know the type and variety of seeds recommended in your area. Such varieties should have the recommendation from the Ministry of Agriculture  NARO  NAADS or extension workers.  2. Note all the quality characteristics and standards on the label and be sure they are what you require. Read all promotional posters. Ask for advice on how and when to plant those seeds.  3. Check the seed packages carefully. All certified seed has been inspected during production by Ministry of Agriculture  and will have an identification label attached to the seed package. It has been tested to make sure it is pure and will germinate.  4. Look around the store to ensure that the seed has been kept properly and protected from rain and excessive heat. Check the package carefully for any signs of damage or insect infestation.  5. Look at the date when the seed was produced. Dont buy seed that is more than one year old or has passed the listed expiry date.  6. Always KEEP your seed package and RECEIPT so that you can complain if there is a problem.  7. Buy early so you can test the germinationn before you plant your entire field.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by UNADA\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsfAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General info","id":"a0r70000000StssAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsgAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Overview","id":"a0r70000000StstAAC","content":"All plants need food (nutrients) for them to grow properly.

Coffee berry disease does not kill coffee trees but it greatly reduces yield which farmers would have got from their coffee crops. Signs of the disease include young expanding coffee berries slowly turning black. Small water filled spots appear on the coffee berries and these spots quickly become dark,sunken and as they spread they make coffee berries rot. Coffee berries also often drop from the branch at an early stage of the disease. Lesions may also occur on young berry stalks, causing them to break off the tree before the berries are affected. The disease also affects ripening berries causing a 'brown blight' phase and this phase is characterised by dark, sunken lesions which cover the ripe red berries. The coffee berry disease may also infect flowers under very wet conditions, and causes brown lesions on petals. Farmers can control the disease by removing berries which are affected from coffee trees, pruning coffee trees after harvesting, removing old stems and thinning out branches as well as timely spraying with copper(NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthkAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves and upper side of leaves losing green colour","id":"a0r70000000StpwAAC","content":"This disease is called coffee leaf rust and it affects leaves causing them to drop if the disease is severe. The disease is favoured by wet warm conditions.The first symptom is formation of small pale yellow spots in diameter on the underside of leaves. As the spots expand they become powdery and yellow to orange and the leaves eventually drop off. This can lead to coffee berry loss and reduction in yields and quality. Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. To prevent coffee leaf rust plant improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency,copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SteDAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making shade trees","id":"a0r70000000StpxAAC","content":"Establishing shade trees in coffee gardens provides good growing conditions for young coffee trees.

Space left between the planting rows should be 2.4m by 2.4m apart to ease other activities which will be done later when caring for coffee and to ensure correct plant population (about 640 coffee trees should be planted per acre). When digging holes farmers should pile top soil on the upper slope and the subsoil on the lower slope in relation tothe hole. Holes made for planting should be 60cm by 60cm by 60cm (2ft by 2ft by 2ft) in size for optimum growing conditions and quick establishment of the tender young coffee roots.

Simsim should be planted at the start of the first rains (usually between  March and April) or at the start of the first rains (usually between July and August). The correct spacing to use when planting is 10 cm between planting holes and 30 cm between the rows of simsim being planted; if this spacing is followed 4 kg of simsim seeds are needed to plant an acre. When planting, simsim seeds should be placed at a depth of between 2 to 5 cm in the soil. The first weeding should be done 2 weeks after simsim has started germinating and the second weeding should be done when thinning is being done (thinning means removing the extra simsim plants so that there is only one plant growing in each planting hole and that correct spacing is followed).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Types grown in Uganda","id":"a0r70000000StXwAAK","content":"Sesim 1 and Sesim 2 are the most common types of simsim grown in Uganda.

Sorghum is normally planted using seeds and it should be planted in fine or smooth soil (which does not have big solid pieces) so that all planted seeds can germinate well and at the same time. Sorghum can either be planted in rows or broadcasted. When planted in rows, a space of 45 to 60 cm should be left between the rows of sorghum while 12 to 20 cm are left between each of the sorghum plants planted in each row (with this spacing about 4,800 sorghum plants can be planted in each acre). If sorghum is planted by broadcasting (throwing the seeds around in the garden) then farmers should remove plants that are too close to one another after the sorghum has germinated.  About 3 to 6 kg of sorghum seeds are needed to plant 1 acre depending on the type of planting used.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast UpdatGSPLIT:ukeywords.tmp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   GSplit Archive                                                                                      &{2909CA96-F846-426C-A5F5-70D3AB4BBBEF}                                                                                                                                                                                                                         E     &     _-    
