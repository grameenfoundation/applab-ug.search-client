Sekedo sorghum is best to use as food or for animal feeds. Epuripur is another common type of sorghum grown in Uganda; it has white seeds, is resistant to stem borers and shoot flies but is usually attacked by birds. Epuripur sorghum matures in 110 days, has sweet grains that can be used for food, baking and brewing.

Irish potatoes harvested before they are fully grown will easily get damaged as they are being transported. Mature (fully grown) potato plants will have most leaves turning yellow or falling off the plant. If diseases like lateblight occur, farmers may harvest irish potatoes before they are fully grown to avoid making a total loss. When harvesting, irish potato plants should be pulled out of the soil using hands if the ground is soft; if the ground is hard, hoes can be used to dig the plant out of the soil but care should be taken not to cut or damage the irish potatoes in the soil.  A good way of protecting irish potatoes from damage as they are being harvested or transported is by cutting the top parts of irish potato plants off about 10 to 14 days before harvesting is done (this helps potatoes to develop a hard skin while they are still in soil). If the harvested potatoes are to be used for planting, farmers should store them in heaps or piles for about 1 to 2 weeks so that their skins can become hard (during this time farmers should identify and remove any rotten or cut potatoes).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StY7AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StY8AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StY9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYAAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Types","id":"a0r70000000StYBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StYCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparation and Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthlAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How and when to plant","id":"a0r70000000Stq4AAC","content":"Farmers should plant and maintain a plant population of 640 coffee trees per acre.

Branches and top parts of the coffee tree which has been attacked break off easily but the main tree usually survives. Leaves on affected coffee trees may also start becoming yellow, drying up and may eventually die. Another sign is bits of eaten wood being pushed out of the tunnels which stem borers make in the coffee stems. Farmers should inspect their arabica coffee gardens regularly to identify infected trees. Ways of controlling stem borers include mantaining a good shade for coffee trees, cutting and burning coffee trees which are heavily infected and have coffee borers inside them. Another way of controlling stem borers is to kill them by inserting a strong wire into the holes made by borers.

Farmers should use sharp equipment when pruning to prevent tearing or damaging bark on the trees. The first pruning is to about 2 metres and can be done from the ground but as the trees grow taller farmers may need to attach poles or handles to pruning saws so that pruning can be done higher (ladders should never be used when pruning high unless if the ground is very flat, even and firm). When pruning bigger branches, farmers should make 2 cuts in the stem and the first cut should be made about 20 cm away from the stem while the second cut is made very close to the stem. The first cut removes weight off the branch so that when the second cutis made the weight does not rip the branch down and cause damage to the stem and tree bark (stem damage from ripping takes a long time to heal, leaves a wound through which diseases can enter the tree and leaves a scar which reduces quality of timber).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to prune","id":"a0r70000000StqKAAS","content":"Farmers shouldalways prune before branches die since pruning after branches are dead makes dead knots form on the tree. Another sign which shows that trees need pruning is when branches from trees growing on separate rows start touching; this shows that competition is starting to increase among the trees and farmers should also start carrying out thinning when they see this. Farmers growing eucalyptus may do the first pruning when the trees are about 1 to 2 years old and pruning height should be 2 metres. Second round of pruning may be done when eucalyptus trees are between 3 to 4 years old and pruning height should be 4 metres. The third round of pruning can be done when eucalyptus trees are between 5 and 6 years old and pruning height is 7 metres (some farmers stop pruning trees at this stage). A fourth round of pruning may be done when the trees are between 7 and 9 years old and pruning height is 10 metres (farmers should note that doing higher pruning is expensive). Farmers should never prune more than half of the tree height.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Importance of pruning","id":"a0r70000000StqLAAS","content":"Pruning makes it easier for farmers to inspect their tree plantations and to carry out operations like thinning, measuring trees or controlling fires. Pruning helps remove heavy branches off a tree before they break off and cause damage to the tree. Pruning also helps remove branches before they die and rot which can cause decay in a tree and can lead to tree diseases. Pruning also raises height of tree branches from the ground which reduces risk of a fire moving from the ground to the upper parts of trees. Pruning at the right time throughout the tree's life ensures that a tree only has knots in the centre of the tree (knots are irregular formations in timber which look like scars) since new wood grows over the scaronce branches have been removed (pruned). Knots reduce quality of timber because they do not look good, make it hard for carpenters to work with wood and they also reduce strength of timber.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"What is pruning","id":"a0r70000000StqMAAS","content":"Pruning is the physical removal of a tree's lower branches and it is usually done in stages throughout the life of trees growing in a plantation.

A planned and coordinated method of putting out a fire is far more effective than having each person trying to put out the fire in their own way (this may also put people's lives in danger). Important things to look out for when fighting a fire are what the fire is doing, how fast it is moving, how strongly it is burning, what it is burning and where it is going. The best way to put out a fire is to fight ahead of it (clearing or burning vegetation ahead of it so that by the time it reaches there it has nothing to burn and dies out). When the front of the fire is cut off, people fighting the fire can start trying to put it out from the back and sides by removing all vegetation which it may burn and this will help to slowly start making the fire smaller and easier to put out. When fighting a fire it is important to make sure that everyone has somewhere to escape to and when the fire gets too strong they can fall back to a safer area and continue fighting the fire. If whatever is being done is not affecting the fire then the people trying to put out the fire need to first stop and rethink about their plan.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StihAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Protecting beans from getting wet in the store","id":"a0r70000000StqRAAS","content":"To protect stored beans from getting wet, farmers should keep bags in which beans are being stored off the ground (this can be done by placing bags on a platform of sticks) and the sacks should also be placed atleast 1 metre away from the walls of the storage area.\nFarmers should never store newly harvested bean seeds with old beans because if the old beans are infected with insects they will spread to the new beans as well.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StihAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing a bean store and its surroundings","id":"a0r70000000StqSAAS","content":"The place in which farmers store the sacks or bags of beans should be clean, dry, well ventilated and it should not have any leaks (when it rains water should not run down the walls of the storage place).Farmers should close any holes on the storage place to keep out rats, insects and water which may damage the beans being stored.

Farmers must always seek advice from agricultural personnel in their area.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsXAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Eastern Uganda","id":"a0r70000000StscAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:21:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsXAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Northern Uganda","id":"a0r70000000StsdAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:21:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsXAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Western Uganda","id":"a0r70000000StseAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:21:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsYAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Seeds","id":"a0r70000000StsfAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:21:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsYAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fertilizers","id":"a0r70000000StsgAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:21:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsXAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Central Uganda","id":"a0r70000000StshAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:21:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SshTAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Near Buikwe","id":"a0r70000000SslxAAC","content":"Kyeswa. 0757364804.

After solarisation manure should be added to the soil, about 20,000Kg/acre.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO,NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties of apples","id":"a0r70000000StYoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site Selection","id":"a0r70000000StYpAAK","content":"The site should be where the trees will be in the sun most or all of the day.

There are many types of termites which attack maize and damage is often very visible during very dry seasons or in areas with irregular rainfall. Termites destroy maize roots and stem bases making maize crops wilt, dry up and fall. Damage continues even after maize has fallen. If termites are many they can destroy all the maize in the field especially if they attack when maize is still young. Old maize attacked by termites will produce very poor grain quality. To control termites, maize farmers should use chemicals like terminator pyrinex, troban, endo sulphan, malataf and dusban. When using Dusban(chloryrifos) a farmer should apply 20 to 40 ml of the chemical mixed in 10 to 20 litres of water per termite mound or anthill. Where there are no termite mounds in the garden, 50 gm of Regent 3-g (fipronil) should be mixed with 2 litres of water and applied to all the locations in the field where termites are feeding. The farmer can also use insecticides that are absorbed by maize (like imidacloprid) to fight termite attacks. Other ways to control termites include ploughing field to destroy the termite nests, runways, and tunnels so that the termites are exposed to predators like ants, birds, chicken which feed on them. Practicing crop rotation can also help in reducing termites. Farmers should remove plant residues and other debris especially moist and decaying woods. Maize should also be harvested at the right time, as termites often attack maize left in the field after maturity.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Holes on maize grain and alot of grain dust in stored maize","id":"a0r70000000StnUAAS","content":"This damage is caused by large grain borers. They can make holes and live in wood and maize. They are cylindrical dark brown and are 3 to 5 mm in length. Their wing covers are flattened at the tip and look like they are cut off. Large grain borers grow from young to adult in about 27 days under favourable conditions. They can attack maize both in field and storage. Signs of large grain borers include holes on maize grains and grain dust in stored maize. Damage is caused by both adults and young large grain borers. Maize grain attacked by large grain borers loses weight, reduces in quality due to presence of droppings, cocoons and insect parts in the maize grain. Maize seeds attacked by large grain borers may also not germinate when planted. To control large grain borers, farmers should harvest maize quickly when it is ready for harvest, store maize in a clean store and in clean containers or sacks and if possible sell the maize stock in the first 3 months after harvest since the extent of large brain borer infestation during the first 3 months of storage is generally low. Mixing diatomite powder with grain before storing in bags or dusting newly harvested dry cobs before storing them with diatomite also helps fight large grain borers (use 1 kg of Diatomite per bag of maize or grain).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-3015:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Large holes on maize grain and maize warm at the surface","id":"a0r70000000StnVAAS","content":"This is caused by maize weevils.

Adult maize weevils continue eating the maize grain even after they come out.Signs of maize weevils include large holes on maize grains, stored maize being hot or warm on the surface, maize becoming damp and seeing the adult maize weevils walking in the stored maize grain.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SshcAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rotary stage","id":"a0r70000000SsmFAAS","content":"Kiirya Siraji . 0773095133.

If the soil has dried  it will be necessary to use either a spade or similar tool to loosen the soil and harvest the roots. Carrots are usually ready for harvesting 60-85 days after sowing. Mature roots should be orange-colored internally down to the blunt tip. A good market price can be fetched from young carrots with a fresh top  but leaving thetop on dries out the root quickly and reduces the marketing period of the crop. An alternative is to cut the top back to about 2 cm and package attractively. For mature carrots the tops are cut down completely to avoid storage rots before marketing. Carrots should be stored separately from other vegetables to prevent a bitter flavor induced by ethylene (a colorless gas with a sweet odor that is produced by many fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening process). Generally carrots store better when they are mature and harvested under moist conditions  and undamaged and free of diseases and pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Biovision and NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StWEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StWFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StWGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWHAA0","content":"Cabbage is often hand-harvested when heads are firm to the touch but before cracking begins.

At times green pods are picked over a long period in home gardens or hedge crops. When growing pigeon peas farmers usually practice ratoon cropping (harvesting pods in one season and leaving pigeon pea plants to produce new pods in the next season). After harvest the stems are cut back to enable the plants to grow again and a second crop is harvested in the following season. After harvesting, farmers can spread out whole pigeon pea plants or pods to dry in the air after which they are threshed (using hands or cattle) and the seeds are cleaned. Clean pigeon peas prevent insect attackwhich can lead to alot of damage in the harvested crop. Farmers can also store pigeon peas as split peas (removed from pods) to reduce attacks from small beetles which are called bruchids.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWWAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWXAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWYAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWZAA0","content":"NoContent \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Commercial varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWaAAK","content":"There are; Sunfola (black seeded  thin seed coat  medium stature  early maturing  40% oil content and up to 1800kg/ha yield)   S400  S430  and SH 3422 whose average seed yields are 1300- 2000 kg/ha and with an oil content of 50%.

One of the symptoms in the fruit is a blackened, dry cavity in the side of the fruit due to one or more \"eyes\" having died. This is known as \"dead eye\". Infection of very young fruit results in an irregular arrangement of fruitlets as some fail to develop. Attacked fruits may also fail to develop a crown. These spots enlarge and the infection spreads into the fruit itself, by which time the crown will often have dried out. The flesh of fruits thus infected will be discoloured and necrotic below the butt of the crown. The whole fruit may eventually become affected.

Field management offers potential effective control. Cut off the fruits showing early symptoms of infection. This will prevent the spread of infections into the fruits. Where this disease is a problem avoid planting near host plants of the thrips and the virus. Even if thrips are not strongly inclined to migrate from their favoured host plants, they will do so if disturbed, for instance by human passing, animals or machinery.

Use certified seeds and should be dressed with a broad spectrum fungicide such as captan or thiran for protection against soil borne pathogens.  After planting  cover them with a screen  as the birds and animals love to dig the seeds out. You can also start them in a seedbed (free of weeds) and with fine non compacted soil with organic matter. Transfer seedlings when they are small. Clear the main garden free of trees  shrubs and weeds. No shading is required. Till the land thoroughly  to a fine non compacted soil. A second ploughing is necessary if planting is onvirgin land. Otherwise a single ploughing is sufficient on already cultivatable land. The crop is line planted (as opposed to broadcast) at a spacing of 2.5 X 1.7ft and 2 seeds per hole. An application of P205 fertilizer before planting and 60kg/ha of Nitrogen at thinning are recommended. Thinning can be done to leave only one or two plants to a hill resulting in an approximate plant population of 55 000 plants/ha. Lower plant populations are recommended in areas where rainfall is limited (on average 33 000-45 000 plants per acre in semi-arid areas). This compares with a recommendation for 45 000-60 000 plants/ha in areas where there is more moisture. Sunflower always point their blooms to the rising sun in the East. Keep this in mind as you determine where to plant them. A planting depth of 1 to 3.5 in. allows sunflower seeds to reach available moisture and gives satisfactory stands.

At this stage  ready plants for harvesting will have the back of the head turned from green to yellow and the bracts have changed to brown. To harvest  cut the stems using a Panga at about 3ft above ground and the heads spiked face down on them and left to dry. Do not delay to harvest as seeds become too dryand shell out leading to field losses. It is better to harvest at 14-15% moisture.

Discard empty grains and straw by aid of wind. Then dry rice. Could dry under the sun on tarpaulin or clean drying floor. DO NOT DRY RAPIDLY (less than 3% moisture reductions per day not recommended) as this will lead to broken rice when milling. When drying  turn every 30-60 minutes to allow equal exposure to the sun. proceed to milling when sufficiently dry and remove big stones before milling.store in a dry place in clean bags or containers for later use.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StWqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWrAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWsAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StWtAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StWuAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvesthandling","id":"a0r70000000StWwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tree management","id":"a0r70000000StWyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Ssl7AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kemikyera market","id":"a0r70000000SsreAAC","content":"Samuel Byaruhanga. 0700466553.

Branches and top parts of the coffee tree which has been attacked break off easily but the main tree usually survives. Leaves on affected coffee trees may also start becoming yellow, drying up and may eventually die. Another sign is bits of eaten wood being pushed out of the tunnels which stem borers make in the coffee stems. Farmers should inspect their robusta coffee gardens regularly to identify infected trees. Ways of controlling stem borers include mantaining a good shade for coffee trees, cutting and burning coffee trees which are heavily infected and have coffee borers inside them. Another way of controlling stem borers is to kill them by inserting a strong wire into the holes made by borers. Farmers can also soak cotton wool in neem oil solution and insert it into bored holes to kill stem borers.

Mealy bugs may also attack coffee which has been sprayed with insecticide sprays. Farmers can control mealy bugs by spraying coffee trees with neem extract (this is made by collecting one kg of  neem leaves, pound the leaves, add 10 litres of water and stir thoroughly every 10 minutes for 1 hour. Farmers should then sieve or strain out the liquid add a matchbox size of soap to the liquid and spray affected coffee).

Other ways to control coffee berry borers is by pruning fields regularly to reduce shade, picking ripe berries regularly (atleast once every 14 days) and spreading tarpaulin or sacks below coffee trees when harvesting to prevent infected berries from falling into the mulch (since this may spread the pests). Farmers should also not allow coffee berries and bags from infested farms to be transported to other farms since this may spread the pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small slightly raised spots on both green and ripening","id":"a0r70000000StoKAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves upper side of leaves losing green colour and leaves falling off trees","id":"a0r70000000StoLAAS","content":"This is coffee leaf rust disease and it is favoured by wet, warm weather. Signs of the disease include pale yellow spots on the lower side of coffee leaves and the spots become powdery turning from yellow to orange as the leaf matures. The coffee tree may also start producing very small coffee berries which turn black before they are ripe. Coffee leaf rust disease also causes leaves to drop and if this happens alot the entire coffee tree can die as well as lose coffee berries. Another sign of coffee leaf rust disease is very small coffee berries which turn black before they are fully ripe. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry,sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee. Farmers can control coffee leaf rust disease by planting resistant types of robusta coffee, ensuring that coffee trees get the nutrients they require and maintaining average shade in the coffee garden.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Coffee trees produce less coffee leaves turn yellow drying up and death of leaves and whole tree rottin into a wet white mass with black lines","id":"a0r70000000StoMAAS","content":"This disease is called root or collar rot and it is transmitted when roots of healthy coffee come into contact with tree roots which have the disease. In coffee, collar rot disease is usually spread from old shade trees or old tree stumps left in the garden when land is being cleared. Signs of collar rot disease include a reduction in coffee being produced by the affected tree, leaves turning yellow, drying up and death of leaves and the whole tree. Roots of affected robusta coffee trees will have a white coating and when the disease is advanced the wood on coffee trees will rot into a white wet mass with black lines running through the tissue. Vertical cracks may also occur at the base of the coffeetree stem. Farmers can control collar rot by ring barking trees before they are cut down (this prevents the fungus which causes collar rot from getting nutrients which enable it to survive in old tree stumps). Farmers should also delay planting (for atleast 2 years) in a garden which had trees affected by collar rot.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfBAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowing drying and death of plants affected coffee remains firmly in soil and black or brown lines on stem when bark is removed","id":"a0r70000000StoNAAS","content":"This is called coffee wilt disease and it is caused by a fungus which blocks movement of water and nutrients from coffee roots to the rest of the plant.

Robusta coffee trees attacked by coffee wilt will remain firmly rooted in the ground. Farmers can control coffee wilt by regularly inspecting their coffee gardens to identify affected trees which should be destroyed by chopping, uprooting and burning the entire plant. Farmers should also restrict movement of infected plant materials and should not replant infected fields with coffee plants for atleast 2 years.

After flowering, most bananas take between 3 and 4 months to mature. Bunches are harvested by cutting them away from the plant just above where the fruit begins. The stem is cut-off with a clean cut at ground level after harvesting the bunch (the stem and other parts of the banana plant that are cut off can be cut into small pieces and used during mulching). It is very important that bunches do not fall or bump during transport, as this causes them to blacken and rot. To avoid damaging the bunches during harvesting at least 2 people should be involved in harvesting (especially for heavy bunches or banana types that have tall trees); one person does the cutting while theother one supports the bunch so that it does not fall to the ground.

If robusta coffee is to be grown on steep slopes then planting holes should be made along contours on the slopes. Farmers should leave a space of 3 metres between planting holes and they should separate  top soil from sub soil (place each type of soil in a separate pile) when digging the holes. When planting, top soil should be placed into the hole first and the hole should be covered with sub soil mixed with manure or compost. The reason for separating soil is because top soil is usually rich in humus which provides ready nutrients to plants and should form the largest part of soil in which the coffee seedling is planted. The size of planting holes should be 60cm by 60cm by 60cm for the best growing conditions and to ease quick development of the young coffee roots. Farmers should apply 1 basin of well rotten manure or mature compost per hole to help robusta seedlings to develop faster.

Mix 1 debe of top soil, 1 debe of manure, 150g lime + 100g TSP fertilizer or 200g SSP where acidity is low anduse this mixture to cover the hole. Place a stick at the centre of the hole to mark the place where the coffee seedling will be put. The hole should be covered 3month before rain starts. Before planting, thoroughly water the seedling and remove it from the polythene pots with its soil block. Use your hand to open a small hole in the center of the covered big hole and place the seedling. Cover the seedling with some soil to the level of the soil block on the seedling. Do not plant seedlings withbent roots since they may easily dry.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Caf Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StfwAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting windbreakers","id":"a0r70000000StofAAC","content":"Permanently planted windbreaks are only recommended in sites with strong winds  and then only where they are needed because of lack of natural forest.

This can lead to coffee berry loss and loss of yields and quality.Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rustby planting improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).

The disease is favoured by wet warm conditions.The first signs are small pale yellow spots on the bottom side of leaves. As the spots expand they become powdery and change colour from yellow to orange and the leaves eventually drop off. This can lead to coffee berry loss and reduction in yields and coffee quality. Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Prevention and control: Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rust by planting improved coffee seed types which are resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee begins flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating theleaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Caf Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Stg9AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small red spots on green and ripening berries","id":"a0r70000000StplAAC","content":"This is called red blister disease and it usually occurs in coffeegrown in low-land areas.

Coffee trees affected by coffee wilt disease will also have blue black staining of wood and vessels under the tree bark. Prevention and control: Coffee wilt can be prevented by buying and planting seeds or young coffee plants from recognized coffee nurseries that are known not to have any coffee diseases, planting coffee in a freshly opened fields and not to allowing any coffee material (like coffee husks orplantings) from other plantations or factories into your coffee garden. This disease can be controlled by regularly checking the coffee garden to identify the disease; coffee trees that show signs of coffee wilt should be cut and burnt where they stand in the garden and garden tools used on trees affected by coffee wilt should be cleaned before they are used on any other coffee tree.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Coffee Development Authority  and Caf Africa\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Stg5AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed control","id":"a0r70000000StpnAAC","content":"Weeds compete with coffee for water and nutrients leading to reduced coffee growth  low yields and poor quality coffee beans.

In order to provide the required cold conditions and water vapour, farmers should place buckets or pots of water in the house where mushrooms are being grown; the mushrooms should also be watered atleast twice a day (in the morning and evening) but farmers that can afford to water more than 2 times should do it. It is best to grow mushrooms in a house that has a grass thatched roof because such houses are cool inside;mushrooms can also be grown in houses that have ironsheet roofs but farmers using such houses should lay out some thatch on the ironsheet roof or make a ceiling in the house to help make it cool inside. The house in which mushrooms are grown should have windows to let in light since it is needed by the mushrooms as they grow; the light inside the house should be enough for someone standing in the centre of the room to read a book. The farmer should put windows on the house to provide light.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSHAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StXYAA0","content":"Mushrooms used to be collected (harvested) from forests and bushes but these days they can be grown in a house. Growing mushrooms in a house protects them from being affected by changes in weather conditions since weather conditions in a house can be controlled. This means a mushroom farmer growing mushrooms in a house can continuously get income during both the dry and wet seasons. Mushrooms take between 4 to 6 weeks to grow from the time they are planted up to harvesting so farmers can get a quick income from this type of agriculture.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXZAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXaAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXbAAK","content":"The most troublesome pests of vanilla are snails and slugs (a type of snail without a shell) andthese feed on and damage young vanilla plants. Other vanilla pests include: Chicken which damage vanilla roots by scratching away the mulched part, exposing the roots and making the plant dry up. Termites are also a major vanilla pest especially in the dry season (termites can kill or stop the support tree from growing normally). There are also black ants that can damage flower buds that have not yet opened which makes flowers drop off before they are pollinated; these black ants also encouragemealy bugs and scale insects to attack vanilla and make flowers drop off before pollination occurs. Thieves can sometimes also steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure that chicken are kept out of vanilla gardens. Black ants can be controlled by applying ash on the soil around the support tree and vanilla vines. Vanilla gardens should be near farmers' homes because this makes it easier to inspect the vanilla everyday and may keep away thieves that steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. Vanilla stores should also be properly contructed to keep out thieves and other pests (any cracks or holes that develop should be closed or repaired quickly).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Disease","id":"a0r70000000StXcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXeAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXfAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXgAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXhAAK","content":"Ginger is ready for harvest in about 9 to 10 months afterit is planted. Signs that ginger is mature enough for harvest include yellowing of leaves and stems of ginger plants breaking. Farmers can choose to leave ginger in the soil (for up to 2 years) if there is no market for them; when the rains come this ginger will germinate again and continue growing for another season. In Uganda ginger is harvested using hands (in a way that is similar to how sweet potatoes are harvested ); mature ginger is dug up from the soil using a hoe and then farmers use hands to break it off the main stem. Roots should be removed from harvested ginger, soil should be cleaned off and the ginger should then be washed in water and laid out in a shade to dry (clean ginger will be bought at better prices at the market). Under good growing conditions and when proper spacing is used at planting, farmers may harvest about 10 sacks of hybrid ginger or 5 sacks of local ginger from 1 acre of land.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MUK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000StXkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXmAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXnAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StXoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"}], "DeletedMenuItems":[], "Images":[{"id":"a0r70000000StinAAC-00P7000000BzZcpEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StipAAC-00P7000000BzZbwEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StikAAC-00P7000000BzZc1EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StioAAC-00P7000000BzZbNEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StimAAC-00P7000000BzZbrEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StilAAC-00P7000000BzZbhEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StiiAAC-00P7000000BzZckEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StqWAAS-00P7000000BzZcaEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000SteyAAC-00P7000000BzZNtEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf2AAC-00P7000000BzZd4EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf0AAC-00P7000000BzZcVEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf1AAC-00P7000000BzZc6EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StezAAC-00P7000000BzZcQEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf5AAC-00P7000000BzZbXEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf4AAC-00P7000000BzZbIEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stf3AAC-00P7000000BzZbcEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StonAAC-00P7000000BzZLOEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StomAAC-00P7000000BzZYeEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StomAAC-00P7000000BzZb3EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StolAAC-00P7000000BzZYAEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StokAAC-00P7000000BzZcGEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StooAAC-00P7000000BzZb8EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StpmAAC-00P7000000BzZbmEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StplAAC-00P7000000BzZbDEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StpkAAC-00P7000000BzZcLEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StpiAAC-00P7000000BzYkREAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZZAA0-00P7000000BzYjtEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZaAAK-00P7000000BzZZ3EAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZYAA0-00P7000000BzZ2UEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StaIAAS-00P7000000BzZZZEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZbAAK-00P7000000BzZUcEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjMAAS-00P7000000BzZYUEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZoAAK-00P7000000BzZayEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StZqAAK-00P7000000BzZatEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StntAAC-00P7000000BzZZYEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjEAAS-00P7000000BzZcBEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjGAAS-00P7000000BzZcuEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjHAAS-00P7000000BzZczEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjAAAS-00P7000000BzZcfEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjBAAS-00P7000000BzZdOEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjIAAS-00P7000000BzZaLEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjFAAS-00P7000000BzZdTEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjDAAS-00P7000000BzZdYEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StjCAAS-00P7000000BzZb9EAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stj9AAC-00P7000000BzZauEAF"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stj8AAC-00P7000000BzZdAEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000Stj7AAC-00P7000000BzZdEEAV"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFOAA0-00P7000000BzZYsEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFPAA0-00P7000000BzZYnEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFQAA0-00P7000000BzZYdEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFRAA0-00P7000000BzZZ2EAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFSAA0-00P7000000BzZZ7EAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFTAA0-00P7000000BzZZCEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFUAA0-00P7000000BzZYiEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFVAA0-00P7000000BzZYxEAN"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFYAA0-00P7000000BzZWBEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFWAA0-00P7000000BzZVGEA3"},{"id":"a0r70000000StFXAA0-00P7000000BzZUrEAN"}], "DeletedImages":[]}
