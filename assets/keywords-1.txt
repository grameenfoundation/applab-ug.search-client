When sowing, space at 40 cm x 15 cm or 60cm x 10cm. Like maize dry planting or planting during the dry seasoncan be done, but planting depth should be increased from the usual 2.5cm to 5cm to prevent early light rains causing the seed to rot by starting the germination and failing to complete it. Thin or remove extra plants to give correct plant population when the crop is 10 cm high. At this time the first weeding should be done and if required top dressing with nitrogen fertilizers like urea applied at a rate of 100kg per hactare and another 100kg after 2-3 weeks later. Apply fertilizers only when the soil is wet, if 2-3 days have passed since it rained apply the fertilizer in the evening to make use of the dew at night to dissolve the fertilizer.

Compost and farm yard manure can be prepared using the same method. It is only the materials that are used to make that change. Compost is made from kitchen waste and green plants. Farm yard manure is made from animal waste and remains of feeds. Collect the materials to be used and mix them very well. Heap them in one pit or make a heap and pour water. Keep mixing them; if it is in a heap, transfer it to another pit so that the materials on the underside are on the top side. Keep adding some water. You can put a long stick in the middle to test whether the manure has decomposing. Your manure may be ready for use in about a month if you follow it up every well\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-10 13:12:26\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGRbAAO","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Control of weeds in maize without using chemicals","id":"a0r70000000TGbCAAW","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-10 09:07:49\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SyXNAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kiboga","id":"a0r70000000T9CDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-06 07:00:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T9CDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Lwamata","id":"a0r70000000T9CEAA0","content":"Weather: Today Friday 05/10/2012, sunny.

Damping-off is another serious problem in the nursery management and it is a combined name for a number of non-specific fungal diseases that cause a serious threat to seedlings after germination. The seedlings begin to rot from the stem tissue just above the soil level (root collar) resulting in the seedlings drying and falling over. The disease begins in patches (spots) and finally spreads to the entire bed. The moist environment created for the maximum growth of the seedlings also favours the growth of the fungi. \r\nPrevention and Control:\r\nIf the attack is at an early stage, chemicals, such as copper oxide and Benlate (Benomyl 50%) are available in Uganda and can be used. The dosage must be according to the instructions of manufacturer. The dosage must be according to the instructions of manufacturer but care needs to be taken not to always use the same product (fungicide) since damping off may fail to be controlled by a particular product or fungicide (resistance may build).  Good spraying frequency is 2 to 3 times a week. Spraying must be done in the afternoon and no watering must be done after spraying. All infected stock must be removed and burnt as soon as possible, if at least 70% of seedlings have been attacked, burn all seedlings, and do not reuse the soil used previously for planting the seedlings, all sowing equipment and the germination environment must be disinfected either through applying fungicides like benomyl or heat the soil before planting. You can prevent damping off by: Controlling moisture (water in the soil), reducing on the shade in the nursery bed, controlling the amount of water used during irrigation, and thorough cleaning of sowing tools and equipment. Note that, the disease occurs in very wet conditions, often caused by over watering and excessive shading (too much shade). Because of the quick spread of the disease, you have to control it immediately.\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-29 14:56:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TDkOAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kisalizi","id":"a0r70000000TDkTAAW","content":"Fabiano 0754966068\r\nSupplies to Masindi and Hoima districts\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Grameen foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-29 13:53:22\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TDkJAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tree and fruit seedlings","id":"a0r70000000TDkOAAW","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-29 13:52:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Syw1AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Abok","id":"a0r70000000Sz8BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sz7SAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Ogwal Trading center B","id":"a0r70000000Sz9iAAC","content":"Stores Maize ,Beans, Cotton, soya Beans, Simsim , in Bags.

The period between planting and harvesting for maize depend upon the variety planted. Harvesting should be done during the dry weather. After harvesting, maize needs to be properly dried, threshed and cleaned before it is stored. Maize stores like cribs or granaries should be well cleaned or fumigated using the right chemical. Maize can also be treated with the right chemical before it is stored. Use clean sisal and nylon sacks for proper maize storage. A lot of maize is lost during harvesting (50% loss), so farmers should aim at reducing this loss. It is good for the farmer not to sell maize immediately after harvesting, if maize is kept for some time after harvesting, it will be sold at a slightly higher price when the demand for maize has increased. In order for farmers to identify markets for maize, they should Join or establish farmer groups so that they can collectively produce enough maize and be able to negotiate good market prices Farmers can get in touch with the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) and the Agricultural staff at the district to advice on possible market outlets. Also farmers have the opportunity to contact Grameen Foundation farmer call centre on 178 or 0312178178 for the current maize prices and market.\r\nFarmers are advised to keep records from land preparation to marketing to help them determine whether they are making profits or losses and thereafter can decide whether to plant maize again or whether to improve on the maize production techniques to get more yields.\n\nAttribution: Information Compiled by Grameen Foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-15 10:07:10\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGkeAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000TH6FAAW","content":"Maize needs a lot of nutrients or food from the soil to give better yields that is why maize responds well to fertilizers like DAP, UREA and NPK.

ACMD is one of the most serious and widespread diseases throughout cassava growing areas in Africa  causing yield reductions. It is caused by a complex of viruses and transmitted through infected cuttings and whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci). The best control measure is to plant resistant varieties and to use disease-free planting materials.

CBB is caused by bacteria  Xanthomonas sp. As control  plant resistant or at least tolerant varieties. Plants infected at an early stage should be pruned to allow for new regrowth or uprooted entirely and burnt. If complete outbreaks on whole farms are observed  it may be necessary to harvest roots immediately and destroy stems and leaves and other plant debris through burning. Infected plant debris may also be ploughed deep into soil. In both situations the land must be allowed to fallow for few years (3 years minimum) before it is planted again to cassava. The bacterium responsible for the disease is unable to survive over a long period outside the host. In communities where land for peasant farming is scarce  fallowing of land may not be a good disease control option.  After destruction of infected plant debris as described in the preceding section  cereals  grains or legumes can be planted on the same piece of land. After three seasons the land can be returned to cassava. Farmers must consciously harvest stems from healthy plants completely free of any of the described symptoms of the disease (i.e. use clean planting materials). It is generally wise to avoid using planting materials from any farm suspected to be under CBB attack even if symptoms of the disease have not been observed on plants. Grasshoppers and other insects that can serve as carriers of the bacterium from farm to farm must be controlled using environmentally friendly measures. Tools used to cut infected plants should be cleaned after use to prevent spread of the bacterium. Crop rotation can help in controlling the spread of CBB.

Young plants are usually harvested in stages  while old plants are more commonly uprooted to prevent the storage roots becoming very fibrous. As cassava roots do not keep fresh more than 2-3 days after harvesting  not all plants are harvested at once  but rather harvesting as the roots are consumed. When cassava is grown for urban markets they are harvested in large amounts. Cassava is usually harvested 9-12 months after planting. It is sometimes harvested earlier if needed for food. Storage roots become too woody if harvesting is delayed. Early maturing varieties are ready for harvesting at 7 months while late maturing varieties are ready 12 months after planting.   Average yields are between 3-4 tons of fresh tubers per acre (7.5-10 tons per ha) although with reasonable care and attention yields of up to 10 tons per acre (25 tons per ha) and more are possible. The ratio of fresh tubers to peeled and dried chips is about 3:1. Cassava does not store well when fresh and therefore has to be peeled  chopped and dried in the sun. During post harvest cassava is peeled and cut into smaller pieces or grating and pressing into small balls before drying. To make flour   pound or grind in a mill the dry slices or balls. It can then be stored in the form of chips or flour under dry conditions.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"MM92 0067 Akena","id":"a0r70000000SteOAAS","content":"Carefully select varieties with multiple pest and disease resistance  high and stable root yields and acceptable quality characteristics that meet endusers’ requirements.

Over mature cuttings have dormant nodes  are lignified and have very little nutrients  while very young cuttings dehydrate easily and are susceptible to pathogens. In case of delay in planting  store cuttings in a dry  well-ventilated  shaded areas away from direct sunlight. Avoid thin stems as they have less nutrients and moisture resulting in weak sprouts that can produce only a few tuberous roots; very big stems are bulky. Medium stems are best. Use cuttings with about 5-7 nodes to increase spouting chances. Small cuttings lose viability and moisture very easily and that may affect spouting ability and establishment. Healthy stems should be used. Avoid bruising stems  as bruises can be entry points for pathogens. Diseased stems sprout poorly.

Banana stumps and plants damaged by wind should be removed from the garden. Banana plants affected by banana weevils should be cut down and chopped into small pieces so that they can rot faster; this will leave weevils with no place to survive. After harvesting farmers should remove all remains of banana plants from the garden and these should be cut into small pieces and dried in the sun. After harvesting cut the banana stem into small pieces that are between 1 and 2 feet long and split them into two pieces. Turn these pieces upside down on the ground near the banana plant. Adult female weevils will lay eggs in these pieces and as these pieces dry the young weevils in them will die. Weevils can also be trapped by placing the split banana stem pieces on top of the corm (part of the banana stem that remains in the soil after the stem is cut at ground level).

Farmers planning to use artificial feeding need to teach their calves how to feed from a bucket. TEACHING CALVES HOW TO FEED FROM A BUCKET: Put 2 fingers in the calf's mouth so that it starts to suck, gently lower the calf's mouth into the colostrum (first milk the cow produces) that has ben milked into a bucket, slowly remove the fingers from the calf's mouth and the calf will start drinking from the bucket. ADVANTAGES of artificial feeding include being easy for farmers to control the amount of milk given to the calf and to keep records of each calf's consumption. It also makes it easier for farmers to teach calves how to feed, calves can feed in a quiet place without any disturbance and it also makes it possible to record and monitor how much milk a cow is producing. Also when artificial feeding is being used and a calf dies or is taken away the cow's milk production will not be affected. WARNING: Farmers should never give calves too much milk because this can cause diarrhea or dysentery (if this occurs the amount of milk being given to the calf should be reduced by half and should be mixed with an equal amount of water). Milk should be given to a calf immediately after milking when the milk is still at the body temperature of the cow. Farmers should observe cleanliness and hygiene (all equipment used to handle milk should be clean) to protect calves from diseases. After 3 weeks farmers should start providing clean water for the claves at all times. A mineral lick should also be hanged in a place where calves can reach so that they can get minerals they need from it.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"lobed leaves red stalk green stem high branching large roots long neck brown outer skin cream inner skin","id":"a0r70000000StetAAC","content":"MM92/0067/Akena has lobed leaves  red stalk  green stem and high branching abilities  shooting ability (2); large roots with long neck  brown outer skin and cream inner skin; resistant to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD)  tolerant to Cassava brown streak disease (Cassava Brown streak Disease)  Cassava Brown streak Disease leaf symptoms are rare and Cassava Brown streak Disease root symptoms are visible but rare; tolerant to cassava green mite and whiteflies; roots taste sweet and with low cyanide content; root yield is more than 16 tons/acre\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small leaves red or purple stalk dark grey stem highly branching moderate roots short neck brown outer skin purple inner skin","id":"a0r70000000SteuAAC","content":"MH972961 has small leaves  red/purple stalk  dark grey stem  highly branching (3); moderate roots with short neck  brown outer skin and purple inner skin; resistant to Cassava Mossaic Disease (CMD)  torelant to Cassava Brown streak Disease  Cassava Brown streak Disease leaf symptom are rare and Cassava Brown streak Disease root symptom visible but very rare; tolerant to cassava green mite and whiteflies; roots taste sweet and with low cyanide content; root yield is more than 10 tons/acre.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StW1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fertiliser application","id":"a0r70000000StevAAC","content":"Beans need fertile soil to grow well so farmers should apply fertilisers if they plant beans on infertile soil.

Young bean plants and those which are not getting enough nutrients may dry up and die if they are attacked by bean flies while older bean plants or those which are getting enough nutrients may survive an attack from bean flies but they will not grow well and will produce very few beans. Bean plants which are growing on infertile soil or are not getting enough water can be badly damaged by bean flies.\nPrevention and Control: Farmers should plant beans early since bean flies are usually few in the early parts of the growing season. Beans should also not be planted near cowpeas, soybeans or any other legumes which may be having bean flies. Farmers can also prevent bean fly attacks by providing good conditions for the beans to grow in (this can be done by mulching and adding organic fertilizers or well decomposed farmyard manure to the soil).

NOTE: When mulching farmers should place the mulch atleast 30 cm away from banana plants because placing mulch very close to banana stems can lead to pest and disease attacks.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting bananas with other crops","id":"a0r70000000StizAAC","content":"The spaces left between rows of bananas during planting can be used to grow other crops.

If the sucker has a very small corm it can be left but its outer skin should be removed. Suckers that have too many spots on their inner parts should not be planted because this may be a sign of weevils and nematodes. The top of the sucker should be cut in a slanting manner to allow rain water to drain off easily so that it does not lead to rotting of the sucker.

They are small, very mobile insects that are white and first and later on develop a brown or pale yellow color. Farmers can separate onion leaves and look carefully if they want to see the thrips and the damage they cause on onion leaves. SIGNS: Thrips make small holes on the upper surface of onion leaves and feed on the plant sap especially from leaves that are just developing deep inside the onion plant; this results in leaves having white and silvery patches. If too many thrips attack an onion plant the tips of leaves on the plant will turn brownish, growth of the plant will slow down, leaves and the onions developing on the plant will lose their normal shape and the onions developing on the plant will reduce in size. Although thrips cause most damage when they attack onions plants that are in the early bulbing stage (forming onions on the plant), farmers should always try to control thrips before the plants reach this stage so that thrips in the garden do not become too many since these are hard to control. Thrips that attack onion plants towards harvesting time (even if the thrips are many) cause little damage since at this stage the onion plants can tolerate thrip attacks. Thrip attacks are usually more serious during dry seasons and at such times whole onion gardens can be destroyed by these pests. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers can prevent thrips from attacking their onion gardens by keeping them well irrigated (dry onion plants are more likely to get attacked by thrips than well watered ones). Weeds and onion plants that are attacked by too many thrips should be removed from the garden.  Thrips can be controlled by spraying affected plants with locally made neem pesticides but farmers MUST get advice from agricultural personnel in the area because some neem pesticides can be harmful to onions that are still growing.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StPrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Natural feeding","id":"a0r70000000StQvAAK","content":"This involves allowing calves to suckle (take milk) directly from their mother's teats.

fly maggots White or cream maggots on lower part of stem blueish leaves which later dry up whole onion plants drying up and sometimes dying","id":"a0r70000000Stj8AAC","content":"This is caused by onion flies (brownish grey flies that are smaller than ordinary house flies); the flies lay eggs in soil from which maggots develop and greatly damage onion plants as they feed. Young ones of onion flies (maggots) are major pests for onions. Onion fly maggots are small (about 0.8 cm when they are fully grown) and are white to cream in color. They feed on onion roots that branch off from the main root from which they enter the main root and make holes inside it and sometimes they can even reach the lower part of the stem. Leaves on onion plants that are affected will dry up and turn abit blue in color; the plants dry up, reduce in size and may eventually die. Onion fly maggots can kill seedlings by feeding just above the lower parts of the seedlings; a maggot can attack several seedlings one after the other and this causes poor plant establishment resulting in many gaps in the garden. Onion fly maggots are also found inside onions developing on the affected plant. As the onion fly maggots feed, they expose the plant to diseases like bacterial soft rot. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should avoid planting onions in soil that has alot of organic matter that is not yet well rotted (such as soil on which animals have just been grazing) and soil that has alot of weeds. Onion flies usually lay their eggs in soil that is wet, and contains a high amount of organic matter (manure and left over plant material).  Farmers should not plant onions in a garden unless the left over plant material is dry and completely rotten. If animal manure is being used as a fertiliser then farmers should allow enough time for the manure to rot and break down before they plant onions. Onions should also not be planted in a garden season after season; farmers should practice crop rotation with crops that are not in the onion family (crops like garlic should not be used in the rotation). Onion gardens should be kept well separated and onions grown in a season following an attack from onion fly maggots should be planted as far away as possible from the soil on which the affected onions were growing in the previous season. All onion plants that are affected by onion fly maggots should be removed from the garden and destroyed (by burning). To prevent onion flies farmers should carefully plough (dig into the soil) plant remains immediately after harvesting is done and the soil should be regularly dug and turned so that young ones of onion flies can be Turn soil to killed. Farmers can also place powdered hot pepper or ginger around onion stems since this helps control the numbers of onion flies in an onion garden. Locally made pesticides made from neem products can also help prevent onion flies from laying eggs in onion gardens if they are sprayed on the onions and soil.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaf miners Rotting on parts where leaves start from and white or yellow lines developing on leaves curling and loss of normal leaf shape and plants rotting","id":"a0r70000000Stj9AAC","content":"This is caused by pests called leaf miners; damage cause by leaf miners is usually not serious (may only make onions lose their healthy appearance and may make them rejected at the market) and they do not affect growth of onions.

On colored onions, the disease usually affects only the neck of the onions making the flattened leaves colorless. Warm, wet conditions favor development of anthracnose. White onions are usually the ones most affected by this disease and it reduces the price at which onions are bought on the market since it spoils the appearance of the onions and makes them reduce in size.\nPREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers can prevent anthracnose by growing colored types of onions especially in areas where the disease is common. Onions should be harvested immediately they mature and they should be protected from rain (or getting wet) in the time between harvesting and when they are stored.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Slippery skin disease Leaves in centre of onion plant drying turning yellow and dying while other leaves remain healthy and green centre of onion sliding out from top when onion is pressed","id":"a0r70000000StjFAAS","content":"This disease is called slippery skin; it does not show any signs on the outer surface of onion bulbs in the early stages. SIGNS: First sign in the field is usually one or two dried leaves in the centre of the group of leaves on an onion plant; these leaves later turn yellow and die starting rom the tip while other leaves on the affected plant remain healthy and green. When the bulb is cut open lengthwise (from top to down), one or more of the inner scales will be water soaked or appear as if it has been cooked.

When the base (lower round part) of the onion is pressed hard enough the whole inner centre core of the onion may slide out at the top (this is why the disease is known as slippery skin).

Downy mildew disease can attack many different types (varieties) of onion plants and other crops that are in the onion family (like garlic). PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should use healthy and quality seeds when planting onions. When planting farmers should use wide spacing between onion plants to avoid overcrowding since this increases humidity which can lead to downy mildew disease.

After 3 to 4 weeks, leaves of affected onion plants start turning yellow and collapse. Onion bulbs (the onions that have developed on a plant) may also be attacked, mainly at the neck and signs of this are yellowish to reddish watery rotting parts.\nPREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should practice early planting and when planting they should use seeds of onion types that have waxy leaves since they are more resistant to disease than onion types that have glossy (smooth and shiny) leaves. Farmers should also increase the amount of ploughing they do between seasons since this helps reduce purple blotch disease, spacing left between onion plants should also be increased. Other good practices farmers can carry out to prevent purple blotch disease in onions include treating seeds before they are planted, carrying out crop rotation, removing remains of onions plants after harvest and planting onions in soil that is well drained.  If the disease has greatly attacked a big onion garden then farmers may be advised to spray their onion plants with fungicides (advice must be got from agricultural personnel in the area on which fungicide to use and how to use it). Farmers growing onions under the organic system of production (which does not involve use of any chemicals) must not spray their onions with fungicides.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StQEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"side view","id":"a0r70000000StR9AAK","content":"For dairy cows to live for long termed as longevity,their rear or hind legs set when viewed from sides should have moderate set (curve) to the hock or cow knees.

They usually attack groundnut seedlings, between planting and about 20 days after planting; they feed on the parts of the germinating groundnuts and later feed on the roots at the part where the plant enters the soil. Damage caused as the millipedes feed can be an entry point for diseases later on; plants that survive millipede attacks will grow slower than normal.  Millipedes also attack groundnuts when the pods are forming (and are still soft); pods attacked by millipedes will easily be attacked by diseases later on. Millipedes also damage flowers on groundnut plants. SIGNS: Farmers will be able to see millipedes moving on the soil in groundnut gardens. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should keep their groundnut gardens clean (by regularly removing weeds as well as parts of plant that fall down). Land on which groundnuts are to be planted should be prepared well and groundnuts should be planted away from forests (millipedes usually breed in such areas). Groundnut pods that are exposed should be covered and any cracks that develop in the soil should be covered.

insects that can be seen on affected groundnut plants collecting together on young parts of the plants (like on new leaves). While aphids are feeding on groundnut plants they can spread diseases (like groundnut rosette disease) and they also reduce the amount of yield that can be harvested especially if they attack during the dry season. SIGNS: Groups of small dark insects collected in groups on young parts of groundnut plants is a sign that aphids have attacked. Young leaves under shich aphids are hiding may also become curled (roll up) but farmers will be able  to see the aphids if they open up these leaves. Another sign of aphids is if groundnut plants are growing slower than normal and if their leaves and stems lose their normal shape. Presence of many ants on the groundnut plants is also a sign that groundnut crops are affected by aphids. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that can withstand aphids (groundnut types Nyanda, Serenut 2 and Igora 1). Farmers should also carry out early planting and avoid leaving wide spaces between groundnut plants; early planting (planting when the rains have just begun) helps groundnuts to grow up quickly and flower before aphids attack while using the correct spacing between groundnut plants (not leaving very wide spaces between them) prevents aphids from coming into the garden coming from the edges of the garden, it prevents numbers of aphids from increasing in the garden and prevents groundnut diseases spread by aphids from breaking out in the groundnuts being grown.

Groundnut flowers attacked by thrips will lose their normal colour and will be covered with scars; the growing parts of the plant that are attacked become black and lose shape as they unfold. PREVENTION and CONTROL:  Farmers should plough and harrow their land before they plant groundnuts; this helps to kill young ones of thrips that may be in the soil.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXNAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Groundnut blight disease Leaves on lower part of stem yellowing and drying white fungus developing around stems of affected groundnut plants","id":"a0r70000000StjfAAC","content":"This disease is called groundnut blight; it attacks all parts of a groundnut plant but the most common part effected is the stem (and infected stems cause the most damage in groundnut crops).

If groundnuts seeds are planted in soil that is wet the disease may attack the seeds and kill them due to the rotting it causes. Fully grown groundnut plants can sometimes also be attacked by this disease. Crown rot disease also produces poisonous substances in groundnut seeds that can cause death or other signs of poisoning in animals or people that eat infected seeds (this poisonousness is more serious in stored groundnuts than in growing groundnuts). SIGNS: Branches on affected groundnut plants dry up permanently and the dead and dry branches are easy to remove from the rest of the plant; the whole plant may dry up too. Infected groundnut pods will also have spots of black things that look like soot. The branches or the entire plant wilts  permanently and the dead and dried branches are easily detached from the collar region. Infected pods reveal patches of black covered spores. When infected groundnut seeds are removed from the soil they will be covered with black things that look like soot. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should be careful not to cause any damage to groundnut pods during harvesting because this can be a starting point for crown rot disease to attack groundnut seeds inside the pods. Groundnuts should be properly dried before they are stored to prevent poisonous substances from developing in the stored groundnut seeds.

PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that are resistant to diseases if they can get seeds of those groundnut types. Crop rotation that involves growing a cereal crop followed by another cereal crop and then groundnuts should be adopted by farmers. Remains of crops that were left over after last season's harvest should be buried when farmers are carrying out land preparation.

Between 10 to 15 people are needed to harvest 1 acre of irish potatoes. Farmers should also set aside some money to buy pesticides and fungicides in case diseases and pests attack the crops (about 1 to 2 kg of fungicides can be enough to spray an acre at once).

In dry and hot areas, mushroom houses should be built under trees to get enough shade and protection from direct sunlight and this helps keep temperatures inside the house cool. Materials that can be used when building a house for mushroom growing include: bricks, mud, wood and grass (for thatching the roof). Grass thatching is preferred becaue it keeps a mushroom house cooler inside better than ironsheet roofs can; if an ironsheet roofed house is used then grass should be spread out on the ironsheet roof to help keep the insides of the house cool.

The earliest sign that vanilla pods are becoming mature is a yellow colour developing on their top ends; the yellow colour spreads all over the vanilla pods and their tips turn brown (when these signs are seen farmers should start harvesting). In Uganda, vanilla harvesting is usually done around July and August (this is the main season) and also around December and January (this is the second season). The vanilla harvesting process usually takes between 2 and 3 months during which farmers should walk through the garden frequently picking the ripe vanilla pods. harvest is spread over a period of 2 to 3 months.

In Thika these take 25-28 months to come into bearing, but have uniform growth and are less susceptible to to premature fruiting. Slips; These are leafy shoot growth arising from the fruit stalks, they take 22-24 months to come into bearing. Suckers; They are leafy shoot growth from the base of the plant where the roots grow. They give the highest yield, but have a long harvest duration. They are also more difficult to plant. Suckers take 18-22 months to come into bearing. To achieve uniform plant growth, selection and sizing of planting material is of major importance. All planting material can be stored upside down in the shade for up to three months and then planted in loose friable dry or preirrigated soil. Only totally healthy and if possible large shoots should be chosen, in order to ensure a uniform crop. Slips can also tolerate dryness, yet not as well as the suckers as they are generally lighter in weight. Slips vary much in size making grading in sizes necessary in order to have uniform plantings. Planting is normally done at the beginning of the long rains. As soon as the plantation begins to produce fruit, any harvested plants should be removed and cut up before being spread over the soil. The plantation will also need to be thinned out from time to time, because suckers, which continually develop, may limit the amount of room available for each individual plant. When all possible niches are already occupied with plants, weeds will have little chance of gaining a foothold, and can also easily be uprooted by hand. Mature weeds can be cut down with a knife or pulled out and then cut up to be used for mulch material. One preventative measure is to sow non-climbing legumes before the pineapples are planted\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Land preparation","id":"a0r70000000StcoAAC","content":"Pineapples perform best in open sunshine areas; therefore the land must be cleared of all trees, shrubs and bushes.

Proper land preparation is extremely important for the development of the roots. Poor land preparation result in poor yields. Perennial weeds should be cleared by repeated deep cultivations during the dry season. Uproot weeds, allow them to dry, harrow into strips and burn them. In areas where the soils have high clay content, it is essential to plough also during the dry season to facilitate root penetration of pineapples. Plough to a depth of 45 cm, or if using hand digging, dig as deep as possible. After ploughing, use a disc harrow to produce a fine tilth. Small-scale growers can uproot old pineapple plants by hand, while large growers can use a large harrow to uproot and chop the stumps and leaves. Nitrogen is essential to the increase of fruit size and total yield. Five to 10 tons of manure per hectare applied to the field before mulching and planting will increase eventual yields. A general application of 180 to 200 kg/ ha of rock phosphate should be added at the same time. Each ratoon crop will again need a new supply of nutrients and will benefit from compost as well as rock phosphate at the same rate. To avoid infection by dry-rot fungus  all of the shoots should be stored in a shady place for wounds to heal and suberise quickly.

SIGNS: Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by early leaf spot will have dark brown spots surrounded by a yellow circle (the spots will be light brown on the lower side of leaves). Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by late leaf spot will have darkers spots with no (or a very light) yellow circle surrounding them; strong attacks of late leaf spot will make leaves fall off the groundnut plant which makes it grow old before the right time.

Farmers should also plough or harrow fields before they transplant tomatoes into them since this helps dry up and kill the cutworms, exposes them to other animals or insects which feed on them and it also helps destroy plant remains in which cutworms hide at times. Farmers can control cutworms by making barriers to protect transplanted seedlings (Barriers can be made by wrapping paper, thin cardboard or similar materials around the base of transplant stems.Toilet rolls can also be used as cutworm collars since they are readily available and can easily be absorbed into soil later on). Other forms of control include keeping natural enemies of cutworms in the garden (for example ants which feed on cutworms) and digging near damaged stems to destroy the cutworms.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVVAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"White Leathery Areas On Fruits","id":"a0r70000000StdFAAS","content":"If the fruit of tomatoes has white leathery areas, it is likely it has been burnt by the sun.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVVAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Purplish Leaves","id":"a0r70000000StdGAAS","content":"If tomato leaves generally appear purple with purple veins,  and have been growing in cool temperatures and there is no evidence of insects, then it is likely plant is lacking phosphorus.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVXAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Intercropping","id":"a0r70000000StdHAAS","content":"Tomatoes should never be intercroped with irish potatoes or members of the cabbage family.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVXAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed Management","id":"a0r70000000StdIAAS","content":"Manage weeds to reduce on yield loses resulting from weed competition, pests and diseases that they harbor.

It is not good to plant simsim on soil that is sloping because it can easily be washed away by water when it rains. Simsim should also not be planted in very windy places or places that have soil that develops a hard layer when rain falls heavily. Simsim should be planted in areas that receive enough evenly distributed rainfall (between 400 to 500 mm) throughout the growing season.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast

Weeding should start when maize is about 0.2 feet high and may not be necessary when maize is at 1.5 feet except in a few cases.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StnLAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Using chemicals to control weeds","id":"a0r70000000StrFAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-11 17:13:45\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StnxAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Amount to use","id":"a0r70000000StrMAAS","content":"When planting, it is recommended that fertilizers like poultry or cattle manure or DAP be used at planting.

This means farmers should plan carefully according to the locations of their tree plantations. Firebreaks can be made either manually (clearing vegetation through digging and slashing to ground level) or through controlled burning. Manual clearing is expensive and is not recommended on steep slopes as it will lead to erosion. Controlled burning is usually the best method of preparing firebreaks and it should be carried out when the sorrounding vegetation is still green. When carrying out controlled burning, a useful technique is to spray a line of Glyphosate which is 1 metre wide on either side of the firebreak to be made (this spraying should be done when the firebreak and sorrounding vegetation is still green). As soon as the sprayed lines have dried, vegetation in the sprayed lines can be burnt off safely. Once the vegetation found in between the sprayed lines has dried off naturally it can also be burnt off since the cleared lines on either side prevent the fire from spreading to other places. Whenever controlled burning is being done people should be ready with fire fighting equipment in case conditions change or the fire jumps to another area. Farmers should also never carry out any burning when conditions are dangerous (when it is too hot or vegetation around is too dry). In areas where vegetation does not dry off naturally, firebreaks can be made by slashing vegetation but the slashing should be done as close to the ground as possible.The slashed vegetation should be left to dry and then it should be collected in the middle of the firebreak and it should be burnt when it is safe to burn and before the fire season starts.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:32\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sts9AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"filling","id":"a0r70000000StsMAAS","content":"Cotton will germinate in 7 to 10 days.
