Tomato seedlings which are 3 to 4 weeks old (and are 15 to 25 cm high with 3 to 5 true leaves) are ready for transplanting. Seedlings must be thoroughly watered 12 to 14 hours before they are lifted out of the seedbed, to avoid excessive damage to the roots. Farmers planning to transplant tomato seedlings should carry out the transplantingin the late afternoon to avoid seedlings getting excessively burnt (scorched) and damaged by the sun. A week before transplanting, watering done on the seedlings should be reduced so that they can harden. After transplanting, farmers should immediately water seedlings with atleast a cup of water per plant since this helps plants to quickly establish themselves in the soil.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting seeds directly","id":"a0r70000000StdzAAC","content":"Tomatoes can be planted and grown either by raising seedlings in a nursery bed and transplanting them to a field later or by directly planting tomato seeds in the field.

ACMD is one of the most serious and widespread diseases throughout cassava growing areas in Africa  causing yield reductions. It is caused by a complex of viruses and transmitted through infected cuttings and whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci). The best control measure is to plant resistant varieties and to use disease-free planting materials. If it is not possible to find completely disease free stems  select cuttings from stem branches instead of from the main stem. Stem cuttings from the branches are more likely to sprout into disease-free plants than stem cuttings from the main stems. Rogue off (uproot and destroy) infected plants during the early stage to reduce secondary spread. Intercrop with tall growing plants like maize to reduce vector movement and transmission of the disease.

CBB is caused by bacteria  Xanthomonas sp. As control  plant resistant or at least tolerant varieties. Plants infected at an early stage should be pruned to allow for new regrowth or uprooted entirely and burnt. If complete outbreaks on whole farms are observed  it may be necessary to harvest roots immediately and destroy stems and leaves and other plant debris through burning. Infected plant debris may also be ploughed deep into soil. In both situations the land must be allowed to fallow for few years (3 years minimum) before it is planted again to cassava. The bacterium responsible for the disease is unable to survive over a long period outside the host. In communities where land for peasant farming is scarce  fallowing of land may not be a good disease control option.  After destruction of infected plant debris as described in the preceding section  cereals  grains or legumes can be planted on the same piece of land. After three seasons the land can be returned to cassava. Farmers must consciously harvest stems from healthy plants completely free of any of the described symptoms of the disease (i.e. use clean planting materials). It is generally wise to avoid using planting materials from any farm suspected to be under CBBattack even if symptoms of the disease have not been observed on plants. Grasshoppers and other insects that can serve as carriers of the bacterium from farm to farm must be controlled using environmentally friendly measures. Tools used to cut infected plants should be cleaned after use to prevent spread of the bacterium. Crop rotation can help in controlling the spread of CBB. Destroy plant debris (remains).\n\nAttribution: IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sore-like sores on stem","id":"a0r70000000SteGAAS","content":"If cankers or sore-like sore appear on the stems; Cankers may develop cracks  exposing inner tissues of stems to the external environment.

Young and older parts of stems may bear cankers; Wilting observed in infected plants and this is often accompanied by defoliation; Dieback of stems is an important symptom of the disease and in some varieties entire infected stems may die back and break off  the disease is called Cassava anthracnose disease (CAD). CAD is caused by fungus Collectothricum gloeosporioides and transmitted by wind or rain splashes. The symptoms of the disease often start and develop rapidly inthe wet season. The most reliable control measure is to use desired anthracnose resistant varieties particularly in localities with high CAD pressures. In situations where desired varieties are susceptible to CAD  healthy stems free of cankers and dieback tissues must be selected to provide cuttings for new plantings. Stems and leaves from infected plants after harvest must be destroyed by burning to reduce the amount of fungal spores and other infective structures that can cause infections inthe next generation of plants.

Young plants are usually harvested in stages  while old plants are more commonly uprooted to prevent the storage roots becoming very fibrous. As cassava roots do not keep fresh more than 2-3 days after harvesting  not all plants are harvested at once  but rather harvesting as the roots are consumed. When cassava is grown for urban markets they are harvested in large amounts. Cassava is usually harvested 9-12 months after planting. It is sometimes harvested earlier if needed for food. Storage roots become too woody if harvesting is delayed. Early maturing varieties are ready for harvesting at 7 months while late maturing varieties are ready 12 months after planting.   Average yields are between 3-4 tons of fresh tubers per acre (7.5-10 tons per ha) although with reasonable care and attention yields of up to 10 tons per acre (25 tons per ha) and more are possible. The ratio of fresh tubers to peeled and dried chips is about 3:1. Cassava does not store well when fresh and therefore has to be peeled  chopped and dried in the sun. During post harvest cassava is peeled and cut into smaller pieces or grating and pressing into small balls before drying. To make flour   pound or grind in a mill the dry slices or balls. It can then be stored in the form of chips or flour under dry conditions.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"MM92 0067 Akena","id":"a0r70000000SteOAAS","content":"Carefully select varieties with multiple pest and disease resistance  high and stable root yields and acceptable quality characteristics that meet endusers? requirements.

Stakes taken from older plants are lignified and they perform poorly due to delayed sprouting and rooting. Cassava should be grown from semi-hardwood cuttings or the hard wood as long as it is not above 18 months. Over- matured and very young stems should be avoided. Over mature cuttings have dormant nodes  are lignified and have very little nutrients  while very young cuttings dehydrate easily and are susceptible to pathogens. In case of delay in planting  store cuttings in a dry  well-ventilated  shaded areas away from direct sunlight. Avoid thin stems as they have less nutrients and moisture resulting in weak sprouts that can produce only a few tuberous roots; very big stems are bulky. Medium stems are best. Use cuttings with about 5-7 nodes to increase spouting chances. Small cuttings lose viability and moisture very easily and that may affect spouting ability and establishment. Healthy stems should be used. Avoid bruising stems  as bruises can be entry points for pathogens. Diseased stems sprout poorly. It is important for the farmer to know the symptoms of most important diseases such as Cassava Brown Streak Disease (Cassava Brown streak Disease) and Cassava Mosaic Disease (Cassava Mossaic Disease) in order to select clean planting materials. Materials cut with well-sharpened machete  knife or saw have smooth edges that are not damaged. Avoid rough handling which may damage the epidermis or buds. Stems may be with an appropriate pesticide at planting. It is not common to treat planting materials but the following treatments may be used. Cut materials to planting size using a sharp machete. Average size cuttings are prepared to 20 ? 25 cm. Thinner cuttings are prepared to about 30 cm. Pre-sprout stem cuttings by placing hardwood or semi-mature stem cuttings in perforated polythene bags without soil. Fill each bag up to two-thirds leaving about one-third for aeration. Tie the bags with a piece of string and place in a shaded area or under a roof. Sprouting occurs in 3-5 days. Some varieties however  require a longer period for sprouting.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storage of excess planting material","id":"a0r70000000SteTAAS","content":"The stakes are vulnerable to adverse climatic conditions  pests  and diseases.

Cone shaped feeders are usually between 35to 45 cm in diameter and can contain up to between 15 to 25 kg of feeds which is enough for about 50 to 80 broilers if 2 or 3 conical feeders are used in a chicken house. Farmers should make sure that they place some drinking water for the chicken atleast 3 meters from the feeders. It is important for the chicken to have enough feeding space;  allow 4 cm for every adult chicken if cone shaped feeders are being used. If horizontal feeding troughs are being used more space is required; broilers between 0 and 2 weeks should have space of 1.5 cm for each chicken, broilers between 3 and 4 weeks should have space of 2.5 cm for each chicken while broilers between 5 and 8 weeks should have space of 5 cm for each bird if horizontal feeding troughs are being used.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StP5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Amount of water needed","id":"a0r70000000StQfAAK","content":"It is very important for broiler chicken to be provided with fresh, clean water to drink at all times; a broiler will drink between 2 and 3 litres of water for each kg of feeds it eats but if room temperatures are high then the amount of water taken by each bird will increase.

NOTE: It is best for farmers to first get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on whether it is necessary to apply chemical fertilisers in their gardens, which fertilisers to use and how to apply them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of bananas not getting enough soil nutrients","id":"a0r70000000StisAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXBAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Erosion Control","id":"a0r70000000StitAAC","content":"Soil erosion occurs when water carries away top soil which is fertile and is needed for bananas to grow well and give high yields at harvest. Soil erosion also exposes plant roots and this may make banana plants fall down. Soil erosion can be controlled by reducing the speed of running water by making trenches that are 2 feet deep and 2 feet wide across the garden. The soil from the trench should be heaped on the upper side of the trench and supported with sticks and grass to prevent it from falling back into the trench. Soil erosion can also be controlled by mulching the plantation with dry grass or intercropping with other crops like beans. Mulch should atleast be 1 inch deep but if grass is available mulch of up to half a foot deep can be used. A distance of between 2 to 3 feet should be left from the banana plant to the mulch. Avoid turning the mulch during weeding since this will make it rot very fast which reduces its ability to control soil erosion and may also damage banana roots. Beans and other crops that are intercropped with bananas should be planted atleast 2 to 3 feet from the banana plant and shallow planting holes should be made for these crops to avoid damaging banana plant roots.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Providing support for banana plants","id":"a0r70000000StiuAAC","content":"When banana plants start producing banana bunches it may be necessary to provide support to the banana plants (this is called propping).

Banana plants need propping especially during the dry season  when there are strong winds or when banana gardensare attacked by pests (like nematodes and weevils) because such conditions make banana plants weak and more likely to fall over. Farmers should use 1 or 2 strong pieces of wood to provide support to banana plants that have banana bunches and this will protect banana plants from falling down. The best types of wood to use for propping are tree branches that have a natural fork on them.

TEACHING CALVES HOW TO FEED FROM A BUCKET: Put 2 fingers in the calf's mouth sothat it starts to suck, gently lower the calf's mouth into the colostrum (first milk the cow produces) that has ben milked into a bucket, slowly remove the fingers from the calf's mouth and the calf will start drinking from the bucket. ADVANTAGES of artificial feeding include being easy for farmers to control the amount of milk given to the calf and to keep records of each calf's consumption. It also makes it easier for farmers to teach calves how to feed, calves can feed in a quiet place without any disturbance and it also makes it possible to record and monitor how much milk a cow is producing. Also when artificial feeding is being used and a calf dies or is taken away the cow's milk production will not be affected. WARNING: Farmers should never give calves too much milk because this can cause diarrhea or dysentery (if this occurs the amount of milk being given to the calf should be reduced by half and should be mixed with an equal amount of water). Milk should be given to a calf immediately after milking when the milk is still at the body temperature of the cow. Farmers should observe cleanliness and hygiene (all equipment used to handle milk should be clean) to protect calves from diseases. After 3 weeks farmers should start providing clean water for the claves at all times.

First symptoms of the disease include small dark brown spots with straight edges (when conditions are wet a grey growth (mould) develops on the lower surface of the spots). These spots increase in size, join together and cause yellowing and death of affected parts and this may cause leaves to drop offwhen they are still young. Stems and pods on bean plants which are infected may also develop reddish brown spots.\nPrevention and Control: Farmers can prevent this disease by planting seeds which are free from angular leaf spot, practising a 2 to 3 year rotation of crops and adding organic manure (not factory made) to the soil to improve soil fertility. Farmers can control angular leaf spot by ploughing into the soil all parts of bean plants which are left behind after harvest. Farmers should also avoid moving around and working in bean gardens which are wet. Farmers can treat beans affected with angular leaf spot using chemicals like Dithane M45 or Benlate.

Bruchids are small beetles with a grey, brown or reddish brown colour which lay eggs on the bean seeds. The young ones of bruchids enter bean seeds and grow from inside for about 1 month where they feed on, damage and reduce ability of bean seeds to germinate. Adult bruchids come out of the bean seeds leaving small holes on the bean seeds. If beans are attacked by a lot of bruchids then many of the bean seeds will have holes on them and adult bruchids may be seen moving in the stored beans. Bruchids can sometimes also attack beans which are still in the garden and here they lay eggs on bean pods which are ripening.\n\nPrevention and Control: Farmers must dry beans in the sun before storing them. Before storing beans farmers can prevent bruchids by mixing bean seeds with things like vegetable oil (coconut or cotton seed oil mixed at a rate of about 5 ml of oil per kg of beans) or plant parts (neem or pyrethrum). If a small amount of beans is to be stored then daily turning of the container in which they are stored can reduce attacks from bruchids. The most effective way of fighting bruchids is keeping beans in clean containers and in a clean store. Old infected beans which remained from last season?s harvest must be removed from the store before new beans are stored.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StW4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small holes and yellow spots on leaves stems swelling and breaking","id":"a0r70000000Stf4AAC","content":"These pests are called bean flies or bean stem maggots. The adult bean fly is a small fly with a shiny black and bluish colour. Bean flies make holes on leaves in which they feed and lay eggs and this makes bean leaves develop yellow spots which is one of the first signs that beans have been attacked by bean flies. Young ones (maggots) of bean flies make holes through bean leaves until they reach lower parts of bean stems where they eat and destroy internal parts of bean plants making the stems become swollen, break up and also reducing on the number of roots which spread out in the soil. When attacked stems start breaking up, young ones of bean flies (which may be yellow, brown or black in colour) may be seen inside the stem and attacked bean plants may start developing roots on their stems. Young bean plants and those which are not getting enough nutrients may dry up and die if they are attacked by bean flies while older bean plants or those which are getting enough nutrients may survive an attack from bean flies but they will not grow well and will produce very few beans. Bean plants which are growing on infertile soil or are not getting enough water can be badly damaged by bean flies.\nPrevention and Control: Farmers should plant beans early since bean flies are usually few in the early parts of the growing season. Beans should also not be planted near cowpeas, soybeans or any other legumes which may be having bean flies. Farmers can also prevent bean fly attacks by providing good conditions for the beans to grow in (this can be done by mulching and adding organic fertilizers or well decomposed farmyard manure to the soil). To control bean flies, farmers should remove and destroy remaining parts of bean plants which show signs of having bean flies.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mbarara Kasese road","id":"a0r70000000SuICAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Liberation road","id":"a0r70000000SuIDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Customs road","id":"a0r70000000SuIEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Taxi Park","id":"a0r70000000SuIFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Naboa road","id":"a0r70000000SuIGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bunghoko Sub county","id":"a0r70000000SuIHAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bamuluya trading centre","id":"a0r70000000SuIIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"St Andrews Cathedral","id":"a0r70000000SuIJAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kumi road","id":"a0r70000000SuIKAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Manafa road","id":"a0r70000000SuILAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bishop Wasike road","id":"a0r70000000SuIMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"St Pauls College","id":"a0r70000000SuINAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Republic Street","id":"a0r70000000SuIOAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pabbo trading centre","id":"a0r70000000SuIPAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Anaka trading center","id":"a0r70000000SuIQAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Reducing leaves on banana plants","id":"a0r70000000StivAAC","content":"Farmers should regularly reduce the number of leaves on banana plants in order to keep banana plants healthy and free from pests and diseases.

They are small, very mobile insects that are white and first and later on develop a brown or pale yellow color. Farmers can separate onion leaves and look carefully if they want to see the thrips and the damage they cause on onion leaves. SIGNS: Thrips make small holes on the upper surface of onion leaves and feed on the plant sap especially from leaves that are just developing deep inside the onion plant; this results in leaves having white and silvery patches. If too many thrips attack an onion plant the tips of leaves on the plant will turn brownish, growth of the plant will slow down, leaves and the onions developing on the plant will lose their normal shape and the onions developing on the plant will reduce in size. Although thrips cause most damage when they attack onions plants that are in the early bulbing stage (forming onions on the plant), farmers should always try to control thrips before the plants reach this stage so that thrips in the garden do not become too many since these are hard to control. Thrips that attack onion plants towards harvesting time (even if the thrips are many) cause little damage since at this stage the onion plants can tolerate thrip attacks. Thrip attacks are usually more serious during dry seasons and at such times whole onion gardens can be destroyed by these pests. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers can prevent thrips from attacking their onion gardens by keeping them well irrigated (dry onion plants are more likely to get attacked by thrips than well watered ones). Weeds and onion plants that are attacked by too many thrips should be removed from the garden.  Thrips can be controlled by spraying affected plants with locally made neem pesticides but farmers MUST get advice from agricultural personnel in the area because some neem pesticides can be harmful to onions that are still growing.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StPrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Natural feeding","id":"a0r70000000StQvAAK","content":"This involves allowing calves tosuckle (take milk) directly from their mother's teats.

fly maggots White or cream maggots on lower part of stem blueish leaves which later dry up whole onion plants drying up and sometimes dying","id":"a0r70000000Stj8AAC","content":"This is caused by onion flies (brownish grey flies that are smaller than ordinary house flies); the flies lay eggs in soil from which maggots develop and greatly damage onion plants as they feed. Young ones of onion flies (maggots) are major pests for onions. Onion fly maggots are small (about 0.8 cm when they are fully grown) and are white to cream in color. They feed on onion roots that branch off from the main root from which they enter the main root and make holes inside it and sometimes they can even reach the lower part of the stem. Leaves on onion plants that are affected will dry up and turn abit blue incolor; the plants dry up, reduce in size and may eventually die. Onion fly maggots can kill seedlings by feeding just above the lower parts of the seedlings; a maggot can attack several seedlings one after the other and this causes poor plant establishment resulting in many gaps in the garden. Onion fly maggots are also found inside onions developing on the affected plant. As the onion fly maggots feed, they expose the plant to diseases like bacterial soft rot. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should avoid planting onions in soil that has alot of organic matter that is not yet well rotted (such as soil on which animals have just been grazing) and soil that has alot of weeds. Onion flies usually lay their eggs in soil that is wet, and contains a high amount of organic matter (manure and left over plant material).  Farmers should not plant onions in a garden unless the left over plant material is dry and completely rotten. If animal manure is being used as a fertiliser then farmers shouldallow enough time for the manure to rot and break down before they plant onions. Onions should also not be planted in a garden season after season; farmers should practice crop rotation with crops that are not in the onion family (crops like garlic should not be used in the rotation). Onion gardens should be kept well separated and onions grown in a season following an attack from onion fly maggots should be planted as far away as possible from the soil on which the affected onions were growingin the previous season. All onion plants that are affected by onion fly maggots should be removed from the garden and destroyed (by burning). To prevent onion flies farmers should carefully plough (dig into the soil) plant remains immediately after harvesting is done and the soil should be regularly dug and turned so that young ones of onion flies can be Turn soil to killed. Farmers can also place powdered hot pepper or ginger around onion stems since this helps control the numbers of onion flies in an onion garden. Locally made pesticides made from neem products can also help prevent onion flies from laying eggs in onion gardens if they are sprayed on the onions and soil.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaf miners Rotting on parts where leaves start from and white or yellow lines developing on leaves curling and loss of normal leaf shape and plants rotting","id":"a0r70000000Stj9AAC","content":"This is caused by pests called leaf miners; damage cause by leaf miners is usually not serious (may only make onions lose their healthy appearance and may make them rejected at the market) and they do not affect growth of onions.

As the rot progresses the affected fleshy onion scales become soft; and farmers can identify onions that have been affected by the disease by pressing on the onion bulb (bulbs that are softer than normal are diseased). Squeezing necks of affected onion bulbs will make them release a watery, bad smelling liquid. Bacterial soft rot usually attacks onions that have been damaged (have wounds) or onions that have been attacked by onion maggots (these cause the disease as they feed); onions with mechanical injuries, bruises or sunscald can easily be affected by bacterial soft rot especially when conditions are  warm and wet.

After 3 to 4 weeks, leaves of affected onion plants start turning yellow and collapse. Onion bulbs (the onions that have developed on a plant) may also be attacked, mainly at the neck and signs of this are yellowish to reddish watery rotting parts.\nPREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should practice early planting and when planting they should use seeds of onion types that have waxy leaves since they are more resistant to disease than onion types that have glossy (smooth and shiny) leaves. Farmers should also increase the amount of ploughing they do between seasons since this helps reduce purple blotch disease, spacing left between onion plants should also be increased. Other good practices farmers can carry out to prevent purple blotch disease in onions include treating seeds before they are planted, carrying out crop rotation, removing remains of onions plants after harvest and planting onions in soil that is well drained.  If the disease has greatly attacked a big onion garden then farmers may be advised to spray their onion plantswith fungicides (advice must be got from agricultural personnel in the area on which fungicide to use and how to use it).

Sorghum is best stored in airtight containers (like drums or tins) or clean sacks and it should be kept in a clean place that is well ventilated (enough air enters and leaves freely).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:38\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When and how to harvest","id":"a0r70000000Stl3AAC","content":"Sorghum is usually ready for harvesting in about 3 months from the time it is planted; sorghum should only be harvested when it has become dry (when the sorghum grain does not produce any liquid when it is crushed), when the the seeds have attained their real color (red) or when a black color has started showing at the tip of the grain.

PREVENTION and CONTROL: After harvesting, all left over parts of sorghum plants should be collected and destroyed. Farmers should plant sorghum types that are resistant to damage from shoot flies. Planting should be done early so that sorghum can grow and reach a stage at which it can survive damage by the time shoot flies attack.  Uniform sowing of the same variety over large areas with the onset of rains reduces the damage by sorghum shoot fly. Applying fertiliser helps sorghum crops to grow strongly which makes them able to survive shoot fly attacks; cattle manure should not be used to fertilise sorghum gardens because it attracts shoot flies.

insects that can be seen on affected groundnut plants collecting together on young parts of the plants (like on new leaves). While aphids are feeding on groundnut plants theycan spread diseases (like groundnut rosette disease) and they also reduce the amount of yield that can be harvested especially if they attack during the dry season. SIGNS: Groups of small dark insects collected in groups on young parts of groundnut plants is a sign that aphids have attacked. Young leaves under shich aphids are hiding may also become curled (roll up) but farmers will be able  to see the aphids if they open up these leaves. Another sign of aphids is if groundnut plants are growingslower than normal and if their leaves and stems lose their normal shape. Presence of many ants on the groundnut plants is also a sign that groundnut crops are affected by aphids. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that can withstand aphids (groundnut types Nyanda, Serenut 2 and Igora 1). Farmers should also carry out early planting and avoid leaving wide spaces between groundnut plants; early planting (planting when the rains have just begun) helps groundnuts to growup quickly and flower before aphids attack while using the correct spacing between groundnut plants (not leaving very wide spaces between them) prevents aphids from coming into the garden coming from the edges of the garden, it prevents numbers of aphids from increasing in the garden and prevents groundnut diseases spread by aphids from breaking out in the groundnuts being grown.

Crops that are good to include in a rotaion with groundnuts include maize , sorghum, millet as well as crops that are able to control weeds (like cassava , sweet potato and sunflower).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Time of planting","id":"a0r70000000StjnAAC","content":"It is hard to come to a standard planting date for planting under the current weather conditions in Uganda BUT farmers should plant as soon as the rains have started to make sure that the planted groundnuts germinate well.  In general, groundnuts are usually planted between mid February and mid April during the first season and in early August for the second season. Planting early in the season helps to increase the amount of groundnuts harvested,improve seed quality of groundnuts harvested and reduces cases of groundnut diseases like rosette disease. Groundnut types that take long to mature (like Igola 1 and Serenut 1R) should only be planted with the first rains in the first season. Groundnut types that take a short time to mature (like Serenut 3R and Serenut 4T) can be planted in any season.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Depth of planting","id":"a0r70000000StjoAAC","content":"When planting, groundnut seeds should be placed at a depth of between 5 to 6 cm. It is vey important for farmers to plant groundnuts in rows and following the recommended spacing becausethis helps prevent diseases diseases (like rosette disease), reduces problems of weeds, ensures that groundnut pods grow uniformly and that a good quality harvest is got. Groundnut seeds should not be planted very close to each other because this will result in plants having few pods growing on them. Planting groundnut seeds with very wide spaces between them will give the farmer few groundnuts at harvest time. Overall,  planting seeds at the recommended depth and spacing makes sure that the groundnut pods growing on the plants are of the same age and stage of development which makes it easier for the farmer to decide when to harvest.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Seed spacing","id":"a0r70000000StjpAAC","content":"When planting groundnuts, farmers should follow the recommended spacing because this helps to make sure that the number of crops planted is enough and can be supported by the land on which they are planted.

Farmers can reduce the space left between rows from 45 cm to 30 cm  if they want and this can help the planted groundnut crops to cover the soil quickly and help prevent serious problems with weeds.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXPAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Seed dressing","id":"a0r70000000StjqAAC","content":"Seed dressing meanstreating the seeds with chemicals before they are planted; this is done to prevent and control diseases that may attack groundnut seedlings and to also keep away pests that may attack the seeds when they are planted. Groundnut seeds bought from agricultural stockists are usually already dressed but farmers can decide to do the seed dressing themselves (especially if they plan to plant their own seeds or those got from other farmers). Seed dressing can be done by mixing Thiram dust uniformly in the groundnut seeds before planting is done; about 120 gm of Thiram dust are needed for every 100 kgs of groundnut seeds. Thiram dust can be bought from certified agricultural stockists and farm input suppliers.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

Between 10 to 15 people are needed to harvest 1 acre of irish potatoes. Farmers should also set aside some money to buy pesticides and fungicides in case diseases and pests attack the crops (about 1 to 2 kg of fungicides can be enough to spray an acre at once).

The disease is caused when substrates (material in which the mushrooms are grown) become dirty. Substrates may become dirty when they are steamed (cooked) for a shorter time, if little fire is used to heat water used in the steaming or if the substrate is handled with dirty hands or equipment after it is steamed. SIGNS: Green spots on the surface of the material on which mushrooms are being grown; these green things prevent mushroom seeds from growing through the substrate and eventually the whole mushroom garden may be covered with this green substance. CONTROL: The most important way of preventing green mould is by keeping everything used in mushroom growing clean. Farmers should make sure that the substrate is steamed over a continuous fire for about 4 to 5 hours and the substrate should be handled with clean, disinfected hands and equipment after it has cooled down. The bags in which the substrate is packed should be clean and should be tied very well and kept in a clean place after the substrate is packed into them. Farmers should clean their hands before toucching the bags in which mushrooms are to be planted. Mushroom seeds that have green spots should not be planted and bags that have green spots on them should be removed from the mushroom house and kept in a separate place to prevent the disease from passing on to other bags in the house.\n\nAttribution: Inromation provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXSAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Marketing harvested mushrooms","id":"a0r70000000StjyAAC","content":"Farmers planning to sell fresh mushrooms should look for market before they even plant the mushrooms; if this is not done then farmers may fail to get a market quickly which will make the mushrooms get spoilt leading to heavy losses.

Apply when the pineapple plants have fully established in the soil and during rain season. Cow dung should be applied when it is dry and not fresh. Chicken litter is most ideal and is best applied when it has undergone decomposition. Coffee husks are more readily available and double as mulch when applied. A 10cm depth of the husks application in the double rows will suffice for the whole growth period until fruit maturity. Additionally apply 75 -83 kg/ acre of rock phosphate as a fertilizer. Apply fertilizers and manures in the same rates at every ratoon crop. Intercropping pineapples with beans, ground nuts or peas will also help fix nitrogen for pineapples. Addition of magnesium also increases fruit weight.

Spacing depends on whether farmers are going to grow pineapples alone or with other crops. Individual plants are placed 1ft (30cm) apart, and space between plants in a row is 2 ft. This spacing gives a smaller number of pineapples at harvest but gives bigger sized fruits; this type of spacing is also good for fertile soils. Farmers that want smaller sized fruits (for export) can use another type of spacing where 1 ft is left between plants in a row, 1 ft is left between the pineapple rows and 4 ft are left between the double rows.  Also a spacing of 1ft (30cm) apart, 1ft (30cm) between the plants and 4ft (120cm) between the double rows can be used.

In Thika these take 25-28 months to come into bearing, but have uniform growth and are less susceptible to to premature fruiting. Slips; These are leafy shoot growth arising from the fruit stalks, they take 22-24 months to come into bearing. Suckers; They are leafy shoot growth from the base of the plant where the roots grow. They give the highest yield, but have a long harvest duration. They are also more difficult to plant. Suckers take 18-22 months to come into bearing. To achieve uniform plant growth, selection and sizing of planting material is of major importance. All planting material can be stored upside down in the shade for up to three months and then planted in loose friable dry or preirrigated soil. Only totally healthy and if possible large shoots should be chosen, in order to ensure a uniform crop. Slips can also tolerate dryness, yet not as well as the suckers as they are generally lighter in weight. Slips vary much in size making grading in sizes necessary in order to have uniform plantings. Planting is normally done at the beginning of the long rains. As soon as the plantation begins to produce fruit, any harvested plants should be removed and cut up before being spread over the soil. The plantation will also need to be thinned out from time to time, because suckers, which continually develop, may limit the amount of room available for each individual plant. When all possible niches are already occupied with plants, weeds will have littlechance of gaining a foothold, and can also easily be uprooted by hand. Mature weeds can be cut down with a knife or pulled out and then cut up to be used for mulch material.

Proper land preparation is extremely important for the development of the roots. Poor land preparation result in poor yields. Perennial weeds should be cleared by repeated deep cultivations during the dry season. Uproot weeds, allow themto dry, harrow into strips and burn them. In areas where the soils have high clay content, it is essential to plough also during the dry season to facilitate root penetration of pineapples. Plough to a depth of 45 cm, or if using hand digging, dig as deep as possible. After ploughing, use a disc harrow to produce a fine tilth. Small-scale growers can uproot old pineapple plants by hand, while large growers can use a large harrow to uproot and chop the stumps and leaves. Nitrogen is essential tothe increase of fruit size and total yield. Five to 10 tons of manure per hectare applied to the field before mulching and planting will increase eventual yields. A general application of 180 to 200 kg/ ha of rock phosphate should be added at the same time. Each ratoon crop will again need a new supply of nutrients and will benefit from compost as well as rock phosphate at the same rate. To avoid infection by dry-rot fungus  all of the shoots should be stored in a shady place for wounds to healand suberise quickly.

Late leaf spot occurs later in the season and does not cause big losses at harvest like early leaf spot does. SIGNS: Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by early leaf spot will have dark brown spots surrounded by a yellow circle (the spots will be light brown on the lower side of leaves). Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by late leaf spot will have darkers spots with no (or a very light) yellow circle surrounding them; strong attacks of late leaf spot will make leaves fall off the groundnut plant which makes it grow old before the right time. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that are resistant to diseases (especially types like Serenut 2 and Igora 1).

Ginger plants having signs of soft rot should be removed from the garden and burnt.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MUK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:38\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nutrients and fertiliser requirements","id":"a0r70000000StkiAAC","content":"Ginger needs alot of nutrient to grow well and this is the reason why farmers are advised to grow ginger in a newly cultivated field; ginger should not be grown in a field for two consecutive seasons (one season after another).

Then wash the fermented seeds in clean water and remove any floating seeds as they are of a poor quality. Then dry the seeds in indirect light and in well-ventilated places. These can be sown or stored in a waterproof container for up to 2 years. Always look out for any mould while in store and dry again if beginning to develop mould.

This means farmers should plan carefully according to the locations of their tree plantations. Firebreaks can be made either manually (clearing vegetation through digging and slashing to ground level) or through controlled burning. Manual clearing is expensive and is not recommended on steep slopes as it will lead to erosion. Controlled burning is usually the best method of preparing firebreaks and it should be carried out when the sorroundingvegetation is still green. When carrying out controlled burning, a useful technique is to spray a line of Glyphosate which is 1 metre wide on either side of the firebreak to be made (this spraying should be done when the firebreak and sorrounding vegetation is still green). As soon as the sprayed lines have dried, vegetation in the sprayed lines can be burnt off safely. Once the vegetation found in between the sprayed lines has dried off naturally it can also be burnt off since the cleared lines on either side prevent the fire from spreading to other places. Whenever controlled burning is being done people should be ready with fire fighting equipment in case conditions change or the fire jumps to another area. Farmers should also never carry out any burning when conditions are dangerous (when it is too hot or vegetation around is too dry). In areas where vegetation does not dry off naturally, firebreaks can be made by slashing vegetation but the slashing should be done as close to theground as possible.The slashed vegetation should be left to dry and then it should be collected in the middle of the firebreak and it should be burnt when it is safe to burn and before the fire season starts.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:32\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sts9AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"filling","id":"a0r70000000StsMAAS","content":"Cotton will germinate in 7 to 10 days.

In some cases one vaccine can protect against 2 or more diseases (such as the combined vaccine for anthrax and black-quarter diseases). Vaccines are not available for all diseases but those vaccines that are available provide a cheaper way of controlling diseases, avoiding illness, preventing losses in production, preventing death and help save on cost of providing treatment for sick cattle. Infact some diseases (like foot and mouth) haveno exact treatment available but only have vaccines available to help prevent those diseases. Some vaccines need to be given once in the life of the animal while others need to be repeated regularly (usually once a year). How vaccination is done: Most vaccines need to be stored in a refrigerator to keep cool because exposing them to high temperatures can make them ineffective. All vaccination should be done with the help of a veterinary doctor or a trained person and only healthy animals (freefrom signs of worm infestation) should be vaccinated. Cows in late pregnancy or that have just given birth should not be vaccinated. If different vaccines for different diseases are to be given to the same animal then an interval of atleast 1 month should be left between each vaccine given.�\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMkAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to stop calves from taking milk","id":"a0r70000000StPQAA0","content":"Weaning (stopping calves from feeding on milk) should be done when they are 3 months old (at this age they should  weigh between 60 to 80 kg).

Farmers should only help if the calf has come out in the normal position but the cow is having difficulty in pushing it out; for all other problems that occur farmers are advised to get help from veterinary personnel in their area or people that have experience in helping cows that are giving birth.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMlAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Normal birth of calves","id":"a0r70000000StPWAA0","content":"Calves being born normally come out with their front legs first followed by the head and the rest of the body; the front feet that appear first face down towards the ground (if the feet that come out firstare facing up then it is likely that the hind feet have come out first).

By about five years from the time of planting  the farmer should leave 10 large or 15 medium sized shade trees in each hectare.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by FAO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making very old cocoa plants to grow afresh","id":"a0r70000000StnEAAS","content":"When cocoa plants grow old  their productivity reduces.

Weaning (stopping calf from taking milk and giving it other types of food) should be done slowly to avoid causing stress to the calf. Calves that weigh below 60 kg when they are 12 weeks old should continue being fed on milk. At weaning, the calf should be provided with plenty of fresh good quality pasture half of which should be legumes like callinadra, leucaena, lablab and mucuna since calves require a lot of proteins (farmers can seek help from agricultural personnel in their area on identifying these legumes). In addition to the plenty of pasture, calves at this age should be given between 1and 2 kg of mixed feeds per day (mixed feeds are factory made food for animals that can be got from shops selling animal feeds); if farmers cannot provide mixed feeds then they should increase the amount of legumes they are giving the calves.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNLAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General calf management","id":"a0r70000000StPzAAK","content":"It is important to provide a lot of care for the calves since they are easily affected by diseases and problems that come from calves not getting enough nutrients.

There are cases where the hind feet show first when a calf is being born (this will be seen if the feet appear upside down as they come out); and when this happens the farmer will need to give help to the cow as it gives birth. When the hind legs show first, the farmer should wait until the feet have come out from the cow?s vulva and then they should start pulling the legs gently at the same time as the cow pushes (the person pulling should first wait and feel the cow pushing then they should gently pull the calf out; they should stop pulling when the cow stops pushing and carry on pulling when it starts pushing again). Once the hind quarter of the calf is out (and only the upper part is left inside the cow) farmers should make sure that the calf gets out quickly. Other abnormal ways in which a calf being born may come out of the cow include the tail showing first, twisted neck, one leg showing first and the farmer should quickly get help from a veterinary doctor in such any of these cases occur.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of a cow about to give birth","id":"a0r70000000StQ1AAK","content":"Between 1 and 2 weeks before giving birth, the cow's vulva swells, the udder becomes large, firm, full and may start producing a thick milky substance. On the day of giving birth, the cow separates itself from the rest of the herd, holds its tail high and off the vulva opening, becomes restless and a clear mucus substance may begin to flow from the vulva. At the actual time of giving birth, the water sac which contains the unborn calf appears and the front feet of the calf appear after the water sac breaks.  During the process of giving birth the cow should be left to produce the calf on its own for atleast 12 hours before farmers come in to try and offer any help.  When the calf is born farmers should remove the mucus from the mouth and nostrils of the calf and let the mother ofthe calf lick the mucus from the rest of the calf's body. The calf's umbilical chord should be cut with a sharp, clean (preferably new) blade and then it should be dipped in iodine solution (this can be got from an animal clinic). If the newborn calf is having difficulty in breathing then the farmer should scratch its nose using a dry piece of grass, hold its hind legs and swing it gently forward and backward or pour cold water on its nose to make it sneeze.\n\nAttribution: Information providedby EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparing for birth of calves","id":"a0r70000000StQ2AAK","content":"The gestation period of a cow will last between 274 and 291 days (9 months).

At theentrance of the dip tank a foot bath helps to remove soil from the feet of the animals so that it does not contaminate the chemical in the dip tank. Foot baths are also put at the gate of the farm for visitors entering the farm to disinfect their feet before entering the farm; foot baths help to kill parasites and disease causing organisms that the animals or visitors may be caring on their feet. Use of foot baths also helps to control foot rot by killing the bacteria that cattle may have on their feet. Foot baths should be at least 2 metres in length and 0.15 metres deep.

The area in which cows give birth should be easy to clean and disinfect thoroughly.

Coccidiosis can kill a large number of chicken before it is identified (this means the disease can attack and kill birds before showing any major signs). Coccidiosis is common in chicken that are being kept under a deep litter system and when the disease breaks out it usually spreads quickly (because birds are always in contact with litter which may have droppings that have the disease) so farmers must do all they can to prevent the disease from breaking out. SIGNS: Affected chicken lose appetite and look dull and weak; sometimes the chicken may also pass out blood stained droppings. The disease also causes a high number of deaths in young chicken and when dead birds are cut open their intestines will be swollen. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure chicks, feed and water are kept away from chicken droppings; chicken should not be overcrowded in the house in which they are being kept. Litter used in the chicken house should be kept dry, turned regularly and any wet areas in it should be removed and replaced with dry litter. If coccidiosis breaks out farmers must immediately remove birds that show signs of the disease and should start treating them immediately. There are drugs (called anticoccidials or coccidiostats) that farmers can mix in chicken feeds to help reduce levels of infection when coccidiocis breaks out (chicken that are to be slaughtered should not be given these drugs atleast 4 days before they are killed to  avoid drugs staying inside the carcass). Chicken with coccidiocis can also be treated by giving them drinking water in which Amprollium has been mixed (farmers MUST always seek advice from veterinary personnel on which drugs to use, amounts to use and how to mix the drugs).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StP1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Vaccination","id":"a0r70000000StP2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Keeping records of chicken","id":"a0r70000000StP3AAK","content":"It is very important for farmers to keep information on the broiler chicken they are keeping; this is called record keeping.

Farmers should turn the litter regularly (using a hoe, shovel or garden rake) so that it remains dry and does not become hard (it should be easy to break up into small bits when it is held in the hands). If litter in a chicken house is not looked after well it will develop a hard surface layer which can give broilers problems like breast blisters (when the birds rest down on hard litter the area around their breasts is bruised and develops wounds which later become hard; this lowers the quality of meat got from the broilers.

Curling or twisting, wrinkling, orfolding of young leaves, yellowish spotting and colouring of older leaves, and may lead to stunting (failure to increase in size) and wilting (plants bend and are stiff looking lifeless) of plants. Growth of sooty mould on honeydew released by aphids affects fruit quality.Control is by checking the crop regularly, whenever necessary spray only affected plants using natural pesticides that are not harmful to natural enemies (for instance neem, ashes, soapy water). Neem products keep away the aphids and have been effective in reducing numbers of aphids on pepper at 10 days intervals.  Chemicals like Dudu-Acelamectin can also be used.Please follow manufacturers instructions when using these chemicals\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYSAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Make small holes in leaves and cut stems of young seedlings at the base","id":"a0r70000000StmUAAS","content":"These are black cutworms.

Appears as circular spots/dots on leaves. The spots/dots are at first brown, later turning white with sunken centres and reddish margins. The symptoms can appear on stems but have not been seen on fruit. Spots on leaves are brown and circular with small to large grey centres and dark brown margins.  Wounds may be many causing leaves to turn yellow, then brown and drop.Infected leaves are dropped off the plant. General loss of leaves occurs under severe disease pressure. Fruits are not attacked. The fungus survives on seeds and in crop wastes. The disease is favoured by long periods of rain. Control is by Planting resistant cultivars if available,use of certified disease-free seeds and practicing good field sanitation. Avoid watering the plants.Water only around the roots. Avoid establishing seedbeds near tomato or pepper fields.It can be easily controlled by fungicides applied on leaves like Indofil M-45.\nPlease follow the manufacturers advice when using these
