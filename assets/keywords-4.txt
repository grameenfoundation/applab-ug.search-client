called pineapple top/ root rot Top rot shows  a colour change of heart leaves from green to yellow or light-brown. The leaf edges curve back and leaves are easily pulled out from the plant. Inside, the stem and leaf bases become soft, rotten and have a bad smell. Root rot causes similar symptoms like top rot. However, the outer leaves start dying beginning from the tips. By this stage, the root system has rotten and plants can be easily pulled from the ground. Root rot often extends through the stem to cause top rot. Fruits from diseased plants are normally small and are not marketable. To prevent, do not plant pineapples in soils that are affected by waterlogging. Improve soil by selective fruit rotations and application of organic compost material.

The fungus also destroys older plants by entering through wounds at the base while weeding or during other field operations. In severe conditions the entire plant may turn dark and rot within two or three days.  Eventually, the skin, flesh and base rots and becomes weakened and the fruit dries out, leaving an empty fruit containing a few fibres. To prevent, Use healthy sets of an appropriate physiological age to ensure rapid germination. Choose sets with at least three nodes to increase the likelihood that the buds towards the Centre will germinate before the fungus invades all the tissues. Use crop management practices that promote germination and rooting. Varieties that are slow to germinate should be treated in hot water (50°C for two hours).Avoid extremely wet or dry soil conditions of the field. Do not plant freshly cut pineapples unless they are dried out. To prevent the spread of the pathogen, avoid wounds to tissue and remove infected pineapple plants.

The farmer should do the drying as soon as possible to avoid attracting insects, fungi and to stop maize seeds from germinating again. Maize can dry in well-constructed crib or stores. Make sure that the maize does not have soil. Dry the maize on clean materials such as cemented floors, mats. After drying, this is how you can check whether the maize is dry: The maize grains become hard when well dried and this can be confirmed by biting a few maize grains with your teeth. When you press the grain, they do not produce a milky substance. Also a salt test can be used where by a farmer can get dry glass, put in some salt and a few dry maize grains, then shake the mixture of maize grain and salt in the glass well for about 5minutes, if after shaking, salt sticks on the sides of the glass, this means maize is not dry but if no salt sticks on the glass surface, then has dried well. Another method used to test if maize has dried is by use of a tool called a moisture meter. This is very accurate in telling whether maize is well dried or not and it’s normally used by the traders.

Spacing should be 50 cm or 60 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants.\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-09-05 11:50:26\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SywLAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bugoye","id":"a0r70000000SzDVAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TEGRAA4","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Epuripur","id":"a0r70000000TEGgAAO","content":"The variety has white seeds and it is can be used for food and beer, and it is grows to about 95 cm tall .Moderately resistant to shoot fly and Stalk borer. It is also moderately , susceptible to midge and storage Pests and is liked by birds. You will need 8kgs to plant an hectare or 2kg to plan an acre using hands. When sowing, space at 40 cm x 15 cm or 60cm x 10cm. Like maize dry planting or planting during the dry seasoncan be done, but planting depth should be increased from the usual 2.5cm to 5cm to prevent early light rains causing the seed to rot by starting the germination and failing to complete it. Thin or remove extra plants to give correct plant population when the crop is 10 cm high. At this time the first weeding should be done and if required top dressing with nitrogen fertilizers like urea applied at a rate of 100kg per hactare and another 100kg after 2-3 weeks later. Apply fertilizers only when the soil is wet, if 2-3 days have passed since it rained apply the fertilizer in the evening to make use of the dew at night to dissolve the fertilizer. It takes between100 to 110days to mature. if well managed, it can yield between 1.5 to 2.5tons per hectare or 0.6 to 1 ton per acre.

are red in colour. It takes long to cook and it can withstand dry conditions (drought). It is not easily attacked by diseases like Bean common mosaic virus disease, black rot and anthracnose. Plant at a spacing of 30cm x 5cm putting one seed per hole or plant at a spacing of 60cm x 10cm putting two seeds per hole. Planting should be done on a weed free fine seedbed at a depth of 3- 5 cm to give a population of over 200,000 Plants per hectare when there is enough moisture in the soil. Excessive moisture may lead to rotting of the seeds or diseased seedlings at an early stage. Plan the planting in such a way that harvesting is during dry period. To plant one hectare you will need between 90kgs to 100kgs of bean seed. It matures in 85 to 95days. If managed well, yield can be between 2 to 2.5tons per hectare\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-17 10:15:10\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TCRRAA4","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"NABE 1 (OBA 1)","id":"a0r70000000TCm8AAG","content":"It is a bushy type (its leaves form a thick cover) with red spotted seeds which are round and of Medium size.

Stable rains are expected to increase with the highest amount occurring in around mid-April. Thereafter, the rains are expected to reduce and the  rainy season expected to end early June. The area is expected to receive the same amount of rainfall like it receives normally. Advice: Farmers should plant early, plant enough food and manage  their crops well to make use of the rain. If possible, farmers should harvest water to use during the next dry season.  People should ensure cleanliness in their homes since disease like cholera is likely to occur due to excess flooding water.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by ministry of water and environment department of meteorology\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-25 14:11:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SyXeAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kibingo","id":"a0r70000000SyZiAAK","content":"Weather: Today Friday 05/10/2012, sunny.

The fungus survives in soil for long period. Farmers can control by ploughing deeply the bean residues after harvest. Practice a 6 to 8 year crop rotation without legumes. Do not feed livestock old bean straw if manure is to be used on bean fields.

It is white in color. These insects occur in large numbers on the undersurfaces of cassava leaves covered with large amounts of white waxy materials. The pest sucks sap from cassava leaves. As it feeds it secretes large amounts of sweet juices called honeydew which causes the growth of black mold on the plant. The blackened leaves dry up and drop. The spiraling whitefly spreads by active flight and by being transported on stem planting materials. To control the pest, the following should be carried out: Monitoring the pests should include checking for eggs on the under sides of the plant. They are usually found on young leaves. Look out for whiteflies flying up when the crop is disturbed or when you pass in the garden. Make sure that the plants are provided with enough water and manure to enable the cassava to grow very first and strong. Inter-planting cassava plants with crops such as hot pepper can help reduce white flies. The only problem is that cassava is taller than the hot pepper plants; therefore, the spacing between the two should be wider. The garden should also be kept weed free; because some weeds will allow these whiteflies to infest them. Also, weeding reduces the competition and allows the cassava to grow faster.

This pest feeds on the cassava leaves and stems and reduces the lengths of the internodes and causes the leaves to clump together into “bunchy tops”; and dry up eventually. The pest sucks sap from cassava leaves and shoot tips. The damage is more severe in the dry than in the wet season. The pest is spread by being carried by farmers on cassava stem planting materials. Control: Plant cassava stems free of mealybugs. Uproot and burn mealybug infested cassava plants. Crop rotation and fallowing. Plant early in the rainy season to allow the cassava plants a good growth before the dry season. Strong plants are more likely to withstand pest attacks.  Apply mulch to avoid moisture stress in sandy or poor soils.  Avoid using infested plant material. Before planting cuttings can be treated with hot water [by dipping them in warm water at 50o C for 5-10 minutes just before planting] to kill all insects/mites and to avoid transfer into the newly planted field.

It is caused by a bacterium which occurs inside cassava stems.  The disease can be controlled through selecting stem cuttings from healthy plants. Infected plants should be pruned to allow for new regrowth or uprooted and burnt.  If complete outbreaks on the farm are observed it may be necessary to harvest roots immediately and destroy stems and leaves and other plant debris through burning or ploughing deep into soil. Land must be allowed to rest for few years (3 years minimum) before cassava is planted again. Tools used to cut infected plants should be cleaned after use to prevent spread of the bacterium. Crop rotation can help in controlling the spread of this disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-07-05 17:03:16\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SyXOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Arua","id":"a0r70000000T9hxAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-06 07:00:04\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T9hxAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Logiri","id":"a0r70000000T9hyAAC","content":"Weather: Today Friday 05/10/2012, sunny.

Before the polythene is used to make a pit (hole) for collecting water, it should be cut from one side to make it open. When it is opened, the polythene will be 5ft wide. However, the 5ft cannot cover the whole pit (hole) from one side to the other.  To cover the whole pit (hole), the farmer will need to join many pieces of polythene to make a wide piece. The length of each piece of polythene will depend on the width of the pit (hole). To know the length of each piece, you need to know the distance from one side of the pit (hole) to the other including the depth on both sides and add 2ft on each side for the polythene that will cover the top sides of the pit (hole). For example if the pit (hole) is 10ft wide and 7ft deep the length of each piece will be 2+7+10+7+2 =28ft. The 2ft are for the part of the polythene that will cover the top sides of the pit (hole), the 7ft is for the polythene to cover the walls of the pit (hole) the and the 10ft is for the polythene that will cover the bottom of the pit (hole). Therefore when making this pit (hole), cut pieces measuring 28ft each. To know how many pieces you need to make the pit (hole), you need to know the distance from one side of the pit (hole) to the other along the long side including the two walls of the pit (hole) and the 2ft to cover the top sides of the pit (hole) on both sides. For example, if the pit (hole) is 20ft long and 7ft deep, this distance will be 2+7+20+7+2=38ft. Divide this by 5 (width of each piece) to know how many pieces are needed.   For example 38 divide by 5 = 8. This means to make a pit (hole) measuring 20ft long, 10ft wide and 7ft deep one will need 8 pieces of polythene each measuring 28ft long.  This means the total amount of polythene needed for a pit (hole) measuring 20ft long, by 10ft wide and 7ft deep is 8 pieces multiplied by 28ft (the length of each piece). This gives 224ft. therefore the farmer will need 224ft of polythene to make a pit (hole) of 20ft long by 10ft by and 7ft deep.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Kathende Harambe Training Centre and Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 13:29:19\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":null,"menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Water Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000T8eLAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 11:56:28\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T8eQAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Places from which rain water can be harvested","id":"a0r70000000T8efAAC","content":"Rain water can be harvested from house roofs, large rocks, roads, and big trees.

For example, each day, 1 person needs 15 litres of water, 1 dairy cow needs 50 litres, 1 local cow needs 20 litres, 1 goat or sheep needs 5 litres and 1 hen needs 0.3 litres for all the uses in a day. Irrigating one acre of land will need 1336 to 2024 litres each day. The farmer should add the amount of water needed by each activity and multiply it with the number of days in the dry season to know the amount of water to harvest for the whole dry season.  Knowing the amount of water needed will help the farmer to decide on the size of tank to buy or construct for keeping the water.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Kathende Harambe Training Centre and Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 12:31:09\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T8epAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting clean water from the roof","id":"a0r70000000T8euAAC","content":"Water collected from roofs can be used for most home activities like cooking, washing, drinking and for animals. To collect clean water from the roof, clean the channels that lead water from the roof to the tank, do not use the water from the first rain after the dry season, kill the rats in the house since they may make the roof dirty with their feaces, nests and food. Clean the tank in which you collect water at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season. The tank can be cleaned by letting it to be filled with water and then opening the outlet tap to let all the water flow out. As the water flows out, it will take away most of the dirt. If there are big particles of dirt that cannot pass through the tap, a person can go into the tank and remove them if the tank has a big mouth.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Kathende Harambe Training Centre and Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 12:38:17\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T8epAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Collecting clean water from rain water flowing on the ground","id":"a0r70000000T8ezAAC","content":"When water running on the ground is collected, it is usually used for irrigation, animal drinking and washing. It may not be used for cooking and drinking since it will be having some dirt. However if it is allowed to settle and treated, it can be used for cooking or drinking. To make sure that the running water collected is clean, plant grass like paspalum around the pit (hole) in which water is collected and in the channel or trench leading water to the pit (hole), remove any objects that you may see in the trench leading water to the pit (hole), do not allow animals to drink water directly from the pit (hole) and children to play near it, washing should not be done near the pit (hole).

Making the bottom of the pit (hole) sloping helps the water to move on one side so that the farmer can still fetch even when little water is remaining. Make the sides of the pit (hole) smooth and remove any sharp stones that may cut the polythene. If the sides of the pit (hole) have many sharp stones than cannot be removed, make mud from soil and cow dung mixed in equal amounts and smear it on the walls of the pit (hole) to make it smooth.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Kathende Harambe Training Centre and Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 13:13:28\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T35EAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Orom","id":"a0r70000000T35OAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-07-17 15:18:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T35JAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mucwini central","id":"a0r70000000T35sAAC","content":"Mwaka Alfred  Location: Mucwini Central .

It cooks quickly with thick sauce. It is not easily attacked by diseases like Bean common mosaic virus disease, black rot and anthracnose. Plant at a spacing of 30cm x 5cm putting one seed per hole or plant at a spacing of 60cm x 10cm putting two seeds per hole. Planting should be done on a weed free fine seedbed at a depth of 3- 5 cm to give a population of over 200,000 Plants per hectare when there is enough moisture in the soil. Excessive moisture may lead to rotting of the seeds or diseased seedlings at an early stage. Plan the planting in such a way that harvesting is during dry period. You will need 60 to 80kgs of seed to plant in one hectare. If managed well, yield can be between 2 to 2.5tons per hectare.

with maize stalk borer have small holes on the young leaves, holes may be seen on the stem with the feaces of the pest near the holes.

Sieve wood ash from a fire place to remove big particles. Mix 2kg of the sieved ash with 50gm (2 match boxes) of dry red pepper powder and mix them well. Pick a small part of this powder with your thumb and first finger and put it in the funnel of each maize plant. When to apply this mixture: Observe the maize for the signs of stalk borers at least once in three days two weeks after planting. Apply the mixture when you see small holes on the maize leaves. Continue applying if you see new holes on the leaves. Red pepper is called Kamulali in Luganda, Kamurali in Runyakitara and Lhukonzo, kalara in Acholi and Pilipili in Kiswahili.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 09:59:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SykRAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Angular Leaf Spot","id":"a0r70000000SykWAAS","content":"The disease is common in all bean growing areas and is transmitted through seed, plant debris, wind and water.

The discoloured areas enlarge until the husks become completely dried although the maize plant is still green. If husks are removed the maize ears appear chaffy and discoloured with a white cotton-like growth between maize grains. Late in the season many small black things (fungi) form on maize grains and cobs. Maize cobs which are heavily affected by ear rot are light in weight. Infection often occurs through the stem and moves from cob to grains. Prevention and control: To prevent ear rot, farmers should plant maize seed types which are resistant to diseases.

These insects usually attack maize when it is planted late in the season. Signs and symptoms The disease has the following signs: Small round scattered spots which start appearing on the youngest leaves. This happens within a week after maize has been infected with the virus. As the number of spots increases and the plant grows, the spots become larger and develop into small broken lines running in the same direction to the leaf veins. When the spots become very many, leaf bases and fully grown leaves lose their green colour. Infected maize may grow slowly and if it is affected early it will not develop cobs or will die while it is still very young. Prevention and control You can control this disease by: Planting varieties that are resistant to the disease such as longe 10H and longe 7H and farmers should avoid planting seeds of maize harvested from the previous seasons.

If the farmer will not get more money by selling to markets at a long distance, then the farmer should sell to the local market and international markets (such as selling agricultural produces like coffee, milk and maize to European countries, USA though these can be easily reach through farmer groups).For more information, call 178/0312178178 or contact your qualified person in your area.\n\nAttribution: Grameen Foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-12 07:46:33\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGjkAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"What farmers should do before starting an enterprises","id":"a0r70000000TGtpAAG","content":"Farmers should first find out the price of the produce in different markets to choose the best prices; get phone numbers of different people buying, storing or transporting the crops in different markets so that he/she can consult them before planning to sell, store or transport.

It is suitable for lowlands and medium land areas. Plant at a spacing of 30cm x 5cm putting one seed per hole or at a spacing of 60cm x 10cm putting two seeds per hole. Planting should be done on a weed free fine seedbed at a depth of 3- 5cm to give a population of over 200,000 Plants per hectare when there is enough moisture in the soil. Excessive moisture may lead to rotting of the seeds or diseased seedlings at an early stage. Plan the planting in such a way that harvesting is during dry period. It matures between 85 to 90days.  To plant one hectare you will need between 90kgs to 100kgs of bean seed. If managed well, it can yield between 2 to 2.5 tons per hectare.\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-17 09:18:41\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T9QJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Ogur","id":"a0r70000000T9QxAAK","content":"Weather: Today Friday 05/10/2012, sunny.
